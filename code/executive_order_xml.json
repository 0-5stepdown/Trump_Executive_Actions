This revisionist movement seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light. Under this historical revision, our Nation's unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed. Rather than fostering unity and a deeper understanding of our shared past, the widespread effort to rewrite history deepens societal divides and fosters a sense of national shame, disregarding the progress America has made and the ideals that continue to inspire millions around the globe.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>The prior administration advanced this corrosive ideology.

This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive. For example, the Smithsonian American Art Museum today features \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an exhibit representing that \u00e2\u0080\u009c[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The exhibit further claims that \u00e2\u0080\u009csculpture has been a powerful tool in promoting scientific racism\u00e2\u0080\u009d and promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct, stating \u00e2\u0080\u009cRace is a human invention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</FP>\n                <FP>The National Museum of African American History and Culture has proclaimed that \u00e2\u0080\u009chard work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cindividualism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe nuclear family\u00e2\u0080\u009d are aspects of \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhite culture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The forthcoming Smithsonian American Women's History Museum plans on celebrating the exploits of male athletes participating in women's sports.

Under his leadership, the United States enjoyed rapid economic growth and prosperity, including an expansion of territorial gains for the Nation. President McKinley championed tariffs to protect U.S. manufacturing, boost domestic production, and drive U.S. industrialization and global reach to new heights.

The Gulf was a crucial artery for America's early trade and global commerce. It is the largest gulf in the world, and the United States coastline along this remarkable body of water spans over 1,700 miles and contains nearly 160 million acres. Its natural resources and wildlife remain central to America's economy today. The bountiful geology of this basin has made it one of the most prodigious oil and gas regions in the world, providing roughly 14% of our Nation's crude-oil production and an abundance of natural gas, and consistently driving new and innovative technologies that have allowed us to tap into some of the deepest and richest oil reservoirs in the world. The Gulf is also home to vibrant American fisheries teeming with snapper, shrimp, grouper, stone crab, and other species, and it is recognized as one of the most productive fisheries in the world, with the second largest volume of commercial fishing landings by region in the Nation, contributing millions of dollars to local American economies. The Gulf is also a favorite destination for American tourism and recreation activities. Further, the Gulf is a vital region for the multi-billion-dollar U.S. maritime industry, providing some of the largest and most impressive ports in the world. The Gulf will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping America's future and the global economy, and in recognition of this flourishing economic resource and its critical importance to our Nation's economy and its people, I am directing that it officially be renamed the Gulf of America.\n                </FP>\n                <P>(b) As such, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, take all appropriate actions to rename as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGulf of America\u00e2\u0080\u009d the U.S. Continental Shelf area bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and extending to the seaward boundary with Mexico and Cuba in the area formerly named as the Gulf of Mexico.

Executive Order 13944 of August 6, 2020 (Combatting Public Health Emergencies and Strengthening National Security by Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs Are Made in the United States), directed certain executive departments and agencies (agencies) to consider a variety of actions to increase their domestic procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs, as defined in section 7 of that order, and to identify supply chain vulnerabilities. The Food and Drug Administration published a list of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs in October 2020. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the Department of Health and Human Services later reduced the list to 86 essential medicines. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>Nearly two in five prescription finished drug products are made in the United States, including many of the essential medicines. However, when it comes to Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), the biologically active components of finished drug products, only about 10 percent of the APIs by volume for the finished drug products used in the United States are made here.</FP>\n                <FP>During my first term, my first Administration created a Strategic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve (SAPIR) to stockpile APIs. Stockpiling APIs is advantageous as APIs are generally lower-cost and have longer shelf lives than the finished drug products they make. Filling the SAPIR will also insulate the United States from the concentration of foreign, sometimes adversary, nations in the world-wide supply of the Key Starting Materials used to make APIs. Moreover, Government purchases of APIs to fill the SAPIR can encourage more domestic production of APIs.</FP>\n                <FP>Unfortunately, the Biden Administration failed to advance the goal of ensuring domestic sources for essential medicines and their precursors despite spending billions of dollars on efforts to secure supply chains. Domestic production and procurement did not increase and the SAPIR is nearly empty. </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Filling the SAPIR with APIs for the Most Critical Medicines.</E>\n                     (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the ASPR shall develop a list, in consultation with agencies with scientific expertise, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy (APEP), and the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor (APHSA), of approximately 26 drugs that are especially critical to the health and security interests of the Nation (the critical drugs) and an accounting of existing, available funds that can be utilized, consistent with statutory authorities, to finance the preparation and opening of the SAPIR repository and to obtain and maintain the 6-month supply of APIs for the critical drugs referenced in subsection (c) of this section shall be provided to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

These civil-rights protections serve as a bedrock supporting equality of opportunity for all Americans. As President, I have a solemn duty to ensure that these laws are enforced for the benefit of all Americans.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Yet today, roughly 60 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, critical and influential institutions of American society, including the Federal Government, major corporations, financial institutions, the medical industry, large commercial airlines, law enforcement agencies, and institutions of higher education have adopted and actively use dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u00e2\u0080\u009d (DEI) or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility\u00e2\u0080\u009d (DEIA) that can violate the civil-rights laws of this Nation.</FP>\n                <FP>Illegal DEI and DEIA policies not only violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system. Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex.</FP>\n                <FP>These illegal DEI and DEIA policies also threaten the safety of American men, women, and children across the Nation by diminishing the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination when selecting people for jobs and services in key sectors of American society, including all levels of government, and the medical, aviation, and law-enforcement communities. Yet in case after tragic case, the American people have witnessed first-hand the disastrous consequences of illegal, pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing.</FP>\n                <FP>The Federal Government is charged with enforcing our civil-rights laws. The purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy.</E>\n                     It is the policy of the United States to protect the civil rights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence, and hard work.

I further order all agencies to enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 3</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Terminating Illegal Discrimination in the Federal Government.</E>\n                     (a) The following executive actions are hereby revoked:\n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"8634\"/>\n                </FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(i) Executive Order 12898 of February 11, 1994 (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations);</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(ii) Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011 (Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce);</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(iii) Executive Order 13672 of July 21, 2014 (Further Amendments to Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity); and</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(iv) The Presidential Memorandum of October 5, 2016 (Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce).</FP>\n                <P>(b) The Federal contracting process shall be streamlined to enhance speed and efficiency, reduce costs, and require Federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with our civil-rights laws.

A critical aspect of this executive function is the responsibility to maintain professionalism and accountability within the civil service. This accountability is sorely lacking today. Only 41 percent of civil service supervisors are confident that they can remove an employee who engaged in insubordination or serious misconduct. Even fewer supervisors\u00e2\u0080\u009426 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0094are confident that they can remove an employee for poor performance.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Accountability is essential for all Federal employees, but it is especially important for those who are in policy-influencing positions. These personnel are entrusted to shape and implement actions that have a significant impact on all Americans. Any power they have is delegated by the President, and they must be accountable to the President, who is the only member of the executive branch, other than the Vice President, elected and directly accountable to the American people. In recent years, however, there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career Federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership. Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Reinstatement of Prior Administration Policy.</E>\n                     Executive Order 13957 of October 21, 2020 (Creating Schedule F in the Excepted Service), is hereby immediately reinstated with full force and effect, subject to the amendments described in section 3 of this order; provided that the date of this order shall be treated as the date of Executive Order 13957.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 3</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Amendments to Prior Administration Policy.</E>\n                     Executive Order 13957 is amended as follows:\n                </FP>\n                <P>(a) replace the letter \u00e2\u0080\u009cF\u00e2\u0080\u009d throughout, when used to designate an excepted service schedule, with the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cPolicy/Career\u00e2\u0080\u009d;</P>\n                <P>(b) in section 1:</P>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(i) remove the text between the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake necessary\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the seventh paragraph and \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcepting such positions\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the eighth paragraph; and</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(ii) insert the text \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompetitive service and the\u00e2\u0080\u009d immediately before the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cadverse action procedures\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the eighth paragraph;</FP>\n                <P>(c) in section 4(a)(i), replace the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cPositions\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cCareer positions\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the final paragraph;</P>\n                <P>(d) in section 4(b)(i), add the text \u00e2\u0080\u009cproviding for the application of Civil Service Rule 6.3(a) to Schedule Policy/Career positions and\u00e2\u0080\u009d after the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cas appropriate\u00e2\u0080\u009d;</P>\n                <P>\n                    (e) in section 5:\n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"8626\"/>\n                </P>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(i) insert the words \u00e2\u0080\u009crecommend that the President\u00e2\u0080\u009d immediately after the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cpetition the Director to\u00e2\u0080\u009d in subsection (a)(i);</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(ii) insert the following text at the end of subsection (c):</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">\u00e2\u0080\u009c(vi) directly or indirectly supervising employees in Schedule Policy/Career positions; or</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(vii) duties that the Director otherwise indicates may be appropriate for inclusion in Schedule Policy/Career.\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(iii) amend subsection (d) to read \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Director shall promptly recommend to the President which positions should be placed in Schedule Policy/Career.\u00e2\u0080\u009d;</FP>\n                <P>(f) in section 6:</P>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(i) designate the existing text as new subsection</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">\u00e2\u0080\u009c(a)\u00e2\u0080\u009d;</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(ii) insert a new subsection (b) that reads: </FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">\u00e2\u0080\u009c(b) Employees in or applicants for Schedule Policy/Career positions are not required to personally or politically support the current President or the policies of the current administration.

Orders to open the borders have endangered the American people and dissolved Federal, State, and local resources that should be used to benefit the American people.

It was under this name that the Department of War, along with the later formed Department of the Navy, won the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II, inspiring awe and confidence in our Nation's military, and ensuring freedom and prosperity for all Americans. The Founders chose this name to signal our strength and resolve to the world. The name \u00e2\u0080\u009cDepartment of War,\u00e2\u0080\u009d more than the current \u00e2\u0080\u009cDepartment of Defense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ensures peace through strength, as it demonstrates our ability and willingness to fight and win wars on behalf of our Nation at a moment's notice, not just to defend.

This often does not happen. Federal grants have funded drag shows in Ecuador, trained doctoral candidates in critical race theory, and developed transgender-sexual-education programs. In 2024, one study claimed that more than one-quarter of new National Science Foundation (NSF) grants went to diversity, equity, and inclusion and other far-left initiatives. These NSF grants included those to educators that promoted Marxism, class warfare propaganda, and other anti-American ideologies in the classroom, masked as rigorous and thoughtful investigation.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>The harm imposed by problematic Federal grants does not stop at propagating absurd ideologies. An unsafe lab in Wuhan, China\u00e2\u0080\u0094likely the source of the COVID-19 pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u0094engaged in gain-of-function research funded by the National Institutes of Health. The NSF gave millions to develop AI-powered social media censorship tools\u00e2\u0080\u0094a direct assault on free speech. Taxpayer-funded grants have also gone to non-governmental organizations that provided free services to illegal immigrants, worsening the border crisis and compromising our safety, and to organizations that actively worked against American interests abroad.</FP>\n                <FP>Even for projects receiving Federal funds that serve an ostensibly beneficial purpose, the Government has paid insufficient attention to their efficacy. For example, a significant proportion of the results of federally funded scientific research projects cannot be reproduced by external researchers. Even at Harvard and Stanford, once considered among America's most prestigious universities, senior researchers have resigned following accusations of data falsification. A substantial portion of many Federal grants for university-led research goes not to scientific project applicants or groundbreaking research, but to university facilities and administrative costs.</FP>\n                <FP>The grant review process itself also undermines the interests of American taxpayers. Writing effective grant applications is notoriously complex, and grant applicants that can afford legal and technical experts are more likely to receive funds\u00e2\u0080\u0094which can then further support these non-mission functions. In addition, there is insufficient interagency coordination and review by relevant subject matter experts to reduce duplication. As a result, the best proposals do not always receive funding, and there is too much unfocused research of marginal social utility.</FP>\n                <FP>In short, there is a strong need to strengthen oversight and coordination of, and to streamline, agency grantmaking to address these problems, prevent them from recurring, and ensure greater accountability for use of public funds more broadly. The Government holds tax revenue in trust for the American people, and agencies should treat it accordingly.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Definitions.</E>\n                     For purposes of this order:\n                </FP>\n                <P>\n                    (a) The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cagency\u00e2\u0080\u009d has the meaning given to it in section 551 of title 5, United States Code, except that such term includes only agencies that have the statutory authority to award, offer, or manage Federal grants \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"38930\"/>\n                    and does not include the Executive Office of the President or any components thereof.\n                </P>\n                <P>(b) The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cagency head\u00e2\u0080\u009d means the highest-ranking official or officials of an agency, such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, Director, Commissioners, or Board of Directors, unless otherwise specified in this order.</P>\n                <P>(c) The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cDirector\u00e2\u0080\u009d means the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</P>\n                <P>(d) The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiscretionary award\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiscretionary grant\u00e2\u0080\u009d means a grant that is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiscretionary award\u00e2\u0080\u009d as that term is defined in 2 CFR 200.1.

This is wrong. Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being. The erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire American system. Basing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>This unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against the ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and scientific terms, replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts.

Americans will require reliable outputs from AI, but when ideological biases or social agendas are built into AI models, they can distort the quality and accuracy of the output.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>One of the most pervasive and destructive of these ideologies is so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u00e2\u0080\u009d (DEI). In the AI context, DEI includes the suppression or distortion of factual information about race or sex; manipulation of racial or sexual representation in model outputs; incorporation of concepts like critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism; and discrimination on the basis of race or sex. DEI displaces the commitment to truth in favor of preferred outcomes and, as recent history illustrates, poses an existential threat to reliable AI.</FP>\n                <FP>For example, one major AI model changed the race or sex of historical figures\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the Pope, the Founding Fathers, and Vikings\u00e2\u0080\u0094when prompted for images because it was trained to prioritize DEI requirements at the cost of accuracy.

The Federal Government is the largest buyer of goods and services in the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094yet conducting business with the Federal Government is often prohibitively inefficient and costly. More than 40 years ago, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) was implemented to establish uniform procedures for acquisitions across executive departments and agencies (agencies). The \u00e2\u0080\u009cvision\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the Federal Acquisition System, codified at section 1.102 of the FAR, is to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeliver on a timely basis the best value product or service to the customer, while maintaining the public's trust and fulfilling public policy objectives[,]\u00e2\u0080\u009d but since its inception, the FAR has swelled to more than 2,000 pages of regulations, evolving into an excessive and overcomplicated regulatory framework and resulting in an onerous bureaucracy. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>Federal procurement under the FAR receives consistently negative assessments regarding its efficiency. Comprehensive studies such as the 2024 Senate committee report entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cRestoring Freedom's Forge\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the 2019 report by the Advisory Panel on Streamlining and Codifying Acquisition Regulations, created by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114-92) and made up of experts in acquisition and procurement policy, conclude that the FAR is a barrier to, rather than a prudent vehicle for, doing business with the Federal Government. Its harmful effects permeate various items paid for by American taxpayers, from commercial products like laptops and office supplies to major defense weapons systems. The management and expenditure of nearly $1 trillion annually in procurements cannot continue on this trajectory. Fortunately, its inadequacies are self-inflicted and can be remedied through a comprehensive reform of the FAR. </FP>\n                <FP>Executive Order 14192 of January 31, 2025 (Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation), established that the policy of the executive branch is to be prudent and financially responsible in the expenditure of funds and to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people. Reforming the FAR will advance this objective. </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy</E>\n                    . It is the policy of the United States to create the most agile, effective, and efficient procurement system possible. Removing undue barriers, such as unnecessary regulations, while simultaneously allowing for the expansion of the national and defense industrial bases is paramount. Accordingly, the FAR should contain only provisions required by statute or essential to sound procurement, and any FAR provisions that do not advance these objectives should be removed. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 3</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Definitions</E>\n                    .

Unfortunately, the experiment of controlling American education through Federal programs and dollars\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the unaccountable bureaucracy those programs and dollars support\u00e2\u0080\u0094has plainly failed our children, our teachers, and our families.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Taxpayers spent around $200 billion at the Federal level on schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, on top of the more than $60 billion they spend annually on Federal school funding. This money is largely distributed by one of the newest Cabinet agencies, the Department of Education, which has existed for less than one fifth of our Nation's history. The Congress created the Department of Education in 1979 at the urging of President Jimmy Carter, who received a first-ever Presidential endorsement from the country's largest teachers' union shortly after pledging to the union his support for a separate Department of Education. Since then, the Department of Education has entrenched the education bureaucracy and sought to convince America that Federal control over education is beneficial. While the Department of Education does not educate anyone, it maintains a public relations office that includes over 80 staffers at a cost of more than $10 million per year.</FP>\n                <FP>Closing the Department of Education would provide children and their families the opportunity to escape a system that is failing them. Today, American reading and math scores are near historical lows. This year's National Assessment of Educational Progress showed that 70 percent of 8th graders were below proficient in reading, and 72 percent were below proficient in math. The Federal education bureaucracy is not working.</FP>\n                <FP>Closure of the Department of Education would drastically improve program implementation in higher education. The Department of Education currently manages a student loan debt portfolio of more than $1.6 trillion. This means the Federal student aid program is roughly the size of one of the Nation's largest banks, Wells Fargo. But although Wells Fargo has more than 200,000 employees, the Department of Education has fewer than 1,500 in its Office of Federal Student Aid. The Department of Education is not a bank, and it must return bank functions to an entity equipped to serve America's students.</FP>\n                <FP>Ultimately, the Department of Education's main functions can, and should, be returned to the States.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Closing the Department of Education and Returning Authority to the States.</E>\n                     (a) The Secretary of Education shall, to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.\n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"13680\"/>\n                </FP>\n                <P>(b) Consistent with the Department of Education's authorities, the Secretary of Education shall ensure that the allocation of any Federal Department of Education funds is subject to rigorous compliance with Federal law and Administration policy, including the requirement that any program or activity receiving Federal assistance terminate illegal discrimination obscured under the label \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u00e2\u0080\u009d or similar terms and programs promoting gender ideology.</P>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 3</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">General Provisions.</E>\n                     (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n                </FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</FP>\n                <P>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</P>\n                <P>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</P>\n                <GPH SPAN=\"1\" DEEP=\"80\" HTYPE=\"RIGHT\">\n                    <GID>Trump.EPS</GID>\n                </GPH>\n                <PSIG>\u00e2\u0080\u0083</PSIG>\n                <PLACE> THE WHITE HOUSE,</PLACE>\n                <DATE> Washington, March 20, 2025.</DATE>\n                <FRDOC>[FR Doc. 2025-05213</FRDOC>\n                <FILED>Filed 3-24-25; 8:45 am]</FILED>\n                <BILCOD>Billing code 3395-F4-P</BILCOD>\n            </EXECORD>\n        </PRESDOCU>",

The American people have witnessed the previous administration engage in a systematic campaign against its perceived political opponents, weaponizing the legal force of numerous Federal law enforcement agencies and the Intelligence Community against those perceived political opponents in the form of investigations, prosecutions, civil enforcement actions, and other related actions. These actions appear oriented more toward inflicting political pain than toward pursuing actual justice or legitimate governmental objectives. Many of these activities appear to be inconsistent with the Constitution and/or the laws of the United States, including those activities directed at parents protesting at school board meetings, Americans who spoke out against the previous administration's actions, and other Americans who were simply exercising constitutionally protected rights.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>The prior administration and allies throughout the country engaged in an unprecedented, third-world weaponization of prosecutorial power to upend the democratic process. It targeted individuals who voiced opposition to the prior administration's policies with numerous Federal investigations and politically motivated funding revocations, which cost Americans access to needed services. The Department of Justice even jailed an individual for posting a political meme. And while the Department of Justice has ruthlessly prosecuted more than 1,500 individuals associated with January 6, and simultaneously dropped nearly all cases against BLM rioters. </FP>\n                <FP>Therefore, this order sets forth a process to ensure accountability for the previous administration's weaponization of the Federal Government against the American people.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy</E>\n                    .

Some financial institutions participated in Government-directed surveillance programs targeting persons participating in activities and causes commonly associated with conservatism and the political right following the events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. The Federal Government suggested that such institutions flag individuals who made transactions related to companies like \u00e2\u0080\u009cCabela's\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cBass Pro Shop\u00e2\u0080\u009d or who made peer-to-peer payments that involved terms like \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cMAGA,\u00e2\u0080\u009d even though there was no specific evidence tying those individuals to criminal conduct.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Bank regulators have used supervisory scrutiny and other influence over regulated banks to direct or otherwise encourage politicized or unlawful debanking activities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOperation Chokepoint,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for example, was a well-documented and systemic means by which Federal regulators pushed banks to minimize their involvement with individuals and companies engaged in lawful activities and industries disfavored by regulators based on factors other than individualized, objective, risk-based standards.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    As a result, individuals, their businesses, and their families have been subjected to debanking on the basis of their political affiliations, religious beliefs or lawful business activities, and have suffered frozen payrolls, debt and crushing interest, and other significant harms to their livelihoods, reputations, and financial well-being. Such practices are incompatible with a free society and the principle that the provision of banking services should be based on material, measurable, and justifiable risks. Such practices, when wielded to discriminate against customers and businesses in credit transactions due to their religion, are also unlawful under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691 \n                    <E T=\"03\">et seq.</E>\n                    ). They further undermine public trust in banking institutions and their regulators, discriminate against political beliefs and free expression of those beliefs, and weaponize a politicized regulatory state.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy.</E>\n                     It is the policy of the United States that no American should be denied access to financial services because of their constitutionally or statutorily protected beliefs, affiliations, or political views, and to ensure that politicized or unlawful debanking is not used as a tool to inhibit such beliefs, affiliations, or political views.

Many firms take actions that threaten public safety and national security, limit constitutional freedoms, degrade the quality of American elections, or undermine bedrock American principles. Moreover, law firms regularly conduct this harmful activity through their powerful pro bono practices, earmarking hundreds of millions of their clients' dollars for destructive causes, that often directly or indirectly harm their own clients. Lawyers and law firms that engage in such egregious conduct should not have access to our Nation's secrets, nor should such conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP (WilmerHale) is yet another law firm that has abandoned the profession's highest ideals and abused its pro bono practice to engage in activities that undermine justice and the interests of the United States. For example, WilmerHale engages in obvious partisan representations to achieve political ends, supports efforts to discriminate on the basis of race, backs the obstruction of efforts to prevent illegal aliens from committing horrific crimes and trafficking deadly drugs within our borders, and furthers the degradation of the quality of American elections, including by supporting efforts designed to enable noncitizens to vote. Moreover, WilmerHale itself discriminates against its employees based on race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws, including through the use of race-based \u00e2\u0080\u009ctargets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</FP>\n                <FP>WilmerHale is also bent on employing lawyers who weaponize the prosecutorial power to upend the democratic process and distort justice.

Mueller's investigation epitomizes the weaponization of government, yet WilmerHale claimed he \u00e2\u0080\u009cembodies the highest value of our firm and profession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mueller's \u00e2\u0080\u009cinvestigation\u00e2\u0080\u009d upended the lives of public servants in my Administration who were summoned before \u00e2\u0080\u009cprosecutors\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the effect of interfering in their ability to fulfill the mandates of my first term agenda.

The Federal Government will no longer tolerate known risks to children's safety and well-being in the classroom that result from the application of school discipline based on discriminatory and unlawful \u00e2\u0080\u009cequity\u00e2\u0080\u009d ideology. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>In January 2014, the Department of Education and the Department of Justice jointly issued a \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear Colleague\u00e2\u0080\u009d letter regarding school discipline. In that letter, the Department of Education and the Department of Justice explained that schools could be found to violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u00e2\u0080\u0094and therefore could lose Federal funding\u00e2\u0080\u0094if their disciplinary decisions ran afoul of a newly imposed disparate-impact framework under which race-neutral disciplinary policies, applied in an even-handed manner, may be improper if members of any racial groups are suspended, expelled, or referred to law enforcement at higher rates than others. The letter effectively required schools to discriminate on the basis of race by imposing discipline based on racial characteristics, rather than on objective behavior alone. </FP>\n                <FP>The consequences harmed students and schools. A 2018 report from the Federal Commission on School Safety (Commission) noted evidence that, because of the 2014 letter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cschools ignored or covered up\u00e2\u0080\u0094rather than disciplined\u00e2\u0080\u0094student misconduct in order to avoid any purported racial disparity in discipline numbers that might catch the eye of the federal government.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As a result, students who should have been suspended or expelled for dangerous behavior remained in the classroom, making all students less safe. </FP>\n                <FP>As the Commission found: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen school leaders focus on aggregate school discipline numbers rather than the specific circumstances and conduct that underlie each matter, schools become less safe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009c[r]esearch clearly indicates that the failure of schools to appropriately discipline disruptive students has consequences for overall student achievement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Commission's seemingly obvious conclusion was that \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisciplinary decisions are best left in the hands of classroom teachers and administrators\u00e2\u0080\u009d and should be based on student behavior, rather than racial statistics.</FP>\n                <FP>Following the Commission's report on December 18, 2018, the 2014 Dear Colleague letter was rescinded. In 2023, however, the previous administration's Department of Education and Department of Justice issued new guidance noting that statistical racial disparities in student discipline may indicate violations of law, and encouraging schools to collect, analyze, and adjust their disciplinary policies in light of racial disciplinary data. The 2023 guidance thus effectively reinstated the practice of weaponizing Title VI to promote an approach to school discipline based on discriminatory equity ideology. As a consequence of these policies, teachers and students are suffering increased levels of classroom disorder and school violence. </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Definitions</E>\n                    .

Yet, while more than 90 million Americans participate in employer-sponsored defined-contribution plans, the vast majority of these investors do not have the opportunity to participate, either directly or through their retirement plans, in the potential growth and diversification opportunities associated with alternative asset investments.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Fiduciaries of 401(k) and other defined-contribution retirement plans must carefully vet and consider all aspects of private offerings, including investment managers' capabilities, experiences, and effectiveness managing alternative asset investments. They do so to protect the Americans whose retirement accounts they administer and for whom they have fiduciary duties to invest safely and prudently.</FP>\n                <FP>During my first term, my Administration issued a 2020 information letter, recognizing that prudent Federal action could encourage the proliferation of investment strategies under which a portion of retirement plan participants' interests are allocated to alternative assets, as is the case for institutional investors.</FP>\n                <FP>Burdensome lawsuits that seek to challenge reasonable decisions by loyal, regulated fiduciaries, and stifling Department of Labor guidance issued since my first term, however, have denied millions of Americans opportunities to benefit from investment in alternative assets.

Such clarification must aim to identify the criteria that fiduciaries should use to prudently balance potentially higher expenses against the objectives of seeking greater long-term net returns and broader diversification of investments. The Secretary shall also propose rules, regulations, or guidance, as the Secretary deems appropriate, that clarify the duties that a fiduciary owes to plan participants under ERISA when deciding whether to make available to plan participants an asset allocation fund that includes investments in alternative assets, which rules, regulations, and guidance may include appropriately calibrated safe harbors.

On December 11, 2019, I issued Executive Order 13899, my first Executive Order on Combating Anti-Semitism, finding that students, in particular, faced anti-Semitic harassment in schools and on university and college campuses. Executive Order 13899 provided interpretive assistance on the enforcement of the Nation's civil rights laws to ensure that they would protect American Jews to the same extent to which all other American citizens are protected. The prior administration effectively nullified Executive Order 13899 by failing to give the terms of the order full force and effect throughout the Government. This order reaffirms Executive Order 13899 and directs additional measures to advance the policy thereof in the wake of the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023, against the people of Israel. These attacks unleashed an unprecedented wave of vile anti-Semitic discrimination, vandalism, and violence against our citizens, especially in our schools and on our campuses. Jewish students have faced an unrelenting barrage of discrimination; denial of access to campus common areas and facilities, including libraries and classrooms; and intimidation, harassment, and physical threats and assault. A joint report by the House Committees on Education and the Workforce, Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, Oversight and Accountability, Veterans' Affairs, and Ways and Means calls the Federal Government's failure to fight anti-Semitism and protect Jewish students \u00e2\u0080\u009castounding.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This failure is unacceptable and ends today.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                        . \n                        <E T=\"03\">Policy.</E>\n                         It shall be the policy of the United States to combat anti-Semitism vigorously, using all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        <E T=\"04\">Sec. 3</E>\n                        . \n                        <E T=\"03\">Additional Measures to Combat Campus Anti-Semitism.</E>\n                         (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department or agency (agency) shall submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, identifying all civil and criminal authorities or actions within the jurisdiction of that agency, beyond those already implemented under Executive Order 13899, that might be used to curb or combat anti-Semitism, and containing an inventory and analysis of all pending administrative complaints, as of the date of the report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism.\n                    </FP>\n                    <P>(b) The report submitted by the Attorney General under this section shall additionally include an inventory and an analysis of all court cases, as of the date of the report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism and indicate whether the Attorney General intends to or has taken any action with respect to such matters, including filing statements of interest or intervention.</P>\n                    <P>\n                        (c) The Attorney General is encouraged to employ appropriate civil-rights enforcement authorities, such as 18 U.S.C. 241, to combat anti-Semitism.\n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"8848\"/>\n                    </P>\n                    <P>(d) The report submitted by the Secretary of Education under this section shall additionally include an inventory and an analysis of all Title VI complaints and administrative actions, including in K-12 education, related to anti-Semitism\u00e2\u0080\u0094pending or resolved after October 7, 2023\u00e2\u0080\u0094within the Department's Office for Civil Rights.</P>\n                    <P>(e) In addition to identifying relevant authorities to curb or combat anti-Semitism generally required by this section, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with each other, shall include in their reports recommendations for familiarizing institutions of higher education with the grounds for inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3) so that such institutions may monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff relevant to those grounds and for ensuring that such reports about aliens lead, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to investigations and, if warranted, actions to remove such aliens.</P>\n                    <FP>\n                        <E T=\"04\">Sec. 4</E>\n                        . \n                        <E T=\"03\">General Provisions.</E>\n                         (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof;

A strong national defense depends on a robust economy and price stability, a resilient manufacturing and defense industrial base, and secure domestic supply chains. Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, in the form of processed minerals are essential raw materials and critical production inputs required for economic and national security. Critical mineral oxides, oxalates, salts, and metals (processed critical minerals), as well as their derivative products\u00e2\u0080\u0094the manufactured goods incorporating them\u00e2\u0080\u0094are similarly foundational to United States national security and defense.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>But processed critical minerals and their derivative products face significant global supply chain vulnerabilities and market distortions due to reliance on a small number of foreign suppliers. These vulnerabilities and distortions have led to significant United States import dependencies. The dependence of the United States on imports and the vulnerability of our supply chains raises the potential for risks to national security, defense readiness, price stability, and economic prosperity and resilience.</FP>\n                <FP>Processed critical minerals and their derivative products are essential for economic security and resilience because they underpin key industries, drive technological innovation, and support critical infrastructure vital for a modern American economy. They are key building blocks of our manufacturing base and foundational to sectors ranging from transportation and energy to telecommunications and advanced manufacturing. These economic sectors are, moreover, foundational to America's national security.</FP>\n                <FP>Processed critical minerals and their derivative products are essential for national security because they are foundational to military infrastructure, energy infrastructure, and advanced defense systems and technologies. They are key building blocks of our defense industrial base and integral to applications such as jet engines, missile guidance systems, advanced computing, radar systems, advanced optics, and secure communications equipment.</FP>\n                <FP>The United States manufacturing and defense industrial bases remain dependent on foreign sources for processed critical mineral products. Many of these foreign sources are at risk of serious, sustained, and long-term supply chain shocks. Should the United States lose access to processed critical minerals from foreign sources, the United States commercial and defense manufacturing base for derivative products could face significant shortages and an inability to meet demand. </FP>\n                <FP>Associated risks arise from a variety of factors. First, global supply chains are prone to disruption from geopolitical tensions, wars, natural disasters, pandemics, and trade conflicts.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    Second, major global foreign producers of processed critical minerals have engaged in widespread price manipulation, overcapacity, arbitrary export restrictions, and the exploitation of their supply chain dominance to distort world markets and thereby gain geopolitical and economic leverage over \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"16438\"/>\n                    the United States and other competitors that depend on processed critical minerals to manufacture derivative products essential to their economic and national security and national defense. Therefore, the import dependence of the United States on processed critical minerals from foreign sources may pose a serious national security risk to the United States economy and defense preparedness. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>Third, the risks arising from America's import dependence on processed critical minerals also extend to derivative products that are integral to the United States economy and economic and national security. For the United States to manufacture derivative products, it must have ready access to an affordable, resilient, and sustainable supply of processed critical minerals. Simultaneously, a resilient and sustainable manufacturing base for derivative products is vital to creating a stable demand base for processed critical minerals. Both must coexist to ensure economic stability and national security. </FP>\n                <FP>Finally, overreliance on a small number of geographic regions amplifies the risks posed by geopolitical instability and regional disruptions.</FP>\n                <FP>In light of the above risks and realities, an investigation under section 232 of the Act (section 232) is necessary to determine whether imports of processed critical minerals and their derivative products threaten to impair national security. </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Definitions</E>\n                    .

In our country, laws are supposed to provide the certainty and order necessary to foster liberty and innovation. Instead, our vast regulatory structure often serves to constrict ordered liberty, not promote it. The United States Code itself is more than 60,000 pages. But unelected agency officials write most of the complex, legally binding rules on top of that, often stretching these statutory provisions beyond what the Congress enacted. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    In particular, the previous administration added more pages to the \n                    <E T=\"03\">Federal Register</E>\n                     than any other in history, with the result that the Code of Federal Regulations now approaches a staggering 200,000 pages.

We need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation's manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness. Caused by the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration, our Nation's inadequate energy supply and infrastructure causes and makes worse the high energy prices that devastate Americans, particularly those living on low- and fixed-incomes.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>This active threat to the American people from high energy prices is exacerbated by our Nation's diminished capacity to insulate itself from hostile foreign actors. Energy security is an increasingly crucial theater of global competition. In an effort to harm the American people, hostile state and non-state foreign actors have targeted our domestic energy infrastructure, weaponized our reliance on foreign energy, and abused their ability to cause dramatic swings within international commodity markets. An affordable and reliable domestic supply of energy is a fundamental requirement for the national and economic security of any nation.</FP>\n                    <FP>The integrity and expansion of our Nation's energy infrastructure\u00e2\u0080\u0094from coast to coast\u00e2\u0080\u0094is an immediate and pressing priority for the protection of the United States' national and economic security. It is imperative that the Federal government puts the physical and economic wellbeing of the American people first.</FP>\n                    <FP>Moreover, the United States has the potential to use its unrealized energy resources domestically, and to sell to international allies and partners a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy. This would create jobs and economic prosperity for Americans forgotten in the present economy, improve the United States' trade balance, help our country compete with hostile foreign powers, strengthen relations with allies and partners, and support international peace and security. Accordingly, our Nation's dangerous energy situation inflicts unnecessary and perilous constraints on our foreign policy.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        The policies of the previous administration have driven our Nation into a national emergency, where a precariously inadequate and intermittent energy supply, and an increasingly unreliable grid, require swift and decisive action. Without immediate remedy, this situation will dramatically deteriorate in the near future due to a high demand for energy and natural resources to power the next generation of technology. The United States' ability to remain at the forefront of technological innovation depends on a reliable supply of energy and the integrity of our Nation's electrical grid. Our Nation's current inadequate development of domestic energy resources leaves us vulnerable to hostile foreign actors and poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.\n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"8434\"/>\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>These numerous problems are most pronounced in our Nation's Northeast and West Coast, where dangerous State and local policies jeopardize our Nation's core national defense and security needs, and devastate the prosperity of not only local residents but the entire United States population. The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy. In light of these findings, I hereby declare a national emergency.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                        . \n                        <E T=\"03\">Emergency Approvals.</E>\n                         (a) The heads of executive departments and agencies (\u00e2\u0080\u009cagencies\u00e2\u0080\u009d) shall identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them, as well as all other lawful authorities they may possess, to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources, including, but not limited to, on Federal lands.

Notably, in 2016 while representing failed Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Perkins Coie hired Fusion GPS, which then manufactured a false \u00e2\u0080\u009cdossier\u00e2\u0080\u009d designed to steal an election. This egregious activity is part of a pattern. Perkins Coie has worked with activist donors including George Soros to judicially overturn popular, necessary, and democratically enacted election laws, including those requiring voter identification. In one such case, a court was forced to sanction Perkins Coie attorneys for an unethical lack of candor before the court.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>In addition to undermining democratic elections, the integrity of our courts, and honest law enforcement, Perkins Coie racially discriminates against its own attorneys and staff, and against applicants. Perkins Coie publicly announced percentage quotas in 2019 for hiring and promotion on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws. It proudly excluded applicants on the basis of race for its fellowships, and it maintained these discriminatory practices until applicants harmed by them finally sued to enforce change.</FP>\n                    <FP>My Administration is committed to ending discrimination under \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u00e2\u0080\u009d policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant race-based and sex-based discrimination, including quotas, but purposefully hide the nature of such discrimination through deceiving language, have engaged in a serious violation of the public trust. Their disrespect for the bedrock principle of equality represents good cause to conclude that they neither have access to our Nation's secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                        . \n                        <E T=\"03\">Security Clearance Review.</E>\n                         (a) The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Perkins Coie, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.\n                    </FP>\n                    <P>(b) The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Perkins Coie.

To address that unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, Executive Order 14066 prohibited, among other things, the importation into the United States of certain products of Russian Federation origin, including crude oil; petroleum; and petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>I have received additional information from various senior officials on, among other things, the actions of the Government of the Russian Federation with respect to the situation in Ukraine. After considering this additional information, among other things, I find that the national emergency described in Executive Order 14066 continues and that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        To deal with the national emergency described in Executive Order 14066, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to impose an additional \n                        <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                         duty on imports of articles of India, which is directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil. In my judgment, imposing tariffs, as described below, in addition to maintaining the other measures taken to address the national emergency described in Executive Order 14066, will more effectively deal with the national emergency described in Executive Order 14066.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                        . \n                        <E T=\"03\">Imposition of Tariffs</E>\n                        .

For far too long, the physical and mental health of the American people has been neglected. Rates of obesity, chronic disease, inactivity, and poor nutrition are at crisis levels, particularly among our children. These trends weaken our economy, military readiness, academic performance, and national morale. President Eisenhower recognized this issue when he created the President's Council on Youth Fitness in response to reports on the poor state of youth fitness in America. As President-elect, John F. Kennedy famously published an essay titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Soft American,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which outlined the imperative for improved health in order to maintain a strong and vital America. During my first term, I renamed the council the \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition\u00e2\u0080\u009d and directed the development of a National Youth Sports Strategy, among other activities.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>My Administration has taken decisive action to reverse this health crisis. In the first month of my second term, I created the President's Make America Healthy Again Commission to restore the urgency of improving the health of Americans. Now, we build further. To advance this commitment, I hereby reestablish the Presidential Fitness Test, which shall be administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the support of the Secretary of Education.</FP>\n                <FP>With this order, I revitalize the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition as a cornerstone of our national health renewal. In 2026, we will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our great Nation, honor the 70th anniversary of the original President's Council on Youth Fitness, and showcase America's continued global dominance in sports.

Notably, in Executive Order 13944 of August 6, 2020 (Combating Public Health Emergencies and Strengthening National Security By Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs Are Made In The United States), I directed each executive department and agency involved in the procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs to take a variety of actions to increase their domestic procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs, as defined in section 7 of that order, and to identify vulnerabilities in our Nation's supply chains for these products. Unfortunately, the prior administration did too little to advance these goals. Critical barriers and information gaps persist in establishing a domestic, resilient, and affordable pharmaceutical supply chain for American patients.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>One key area of concern is the length of time it takes to build pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the United States today. New construction must navigate myriad Federal, State, and local requirements ranging from building standards and zoning restrictions to environmental protocols that together diminish the certainty needed to generate investment for large manufacturing projects. For pharmaceutical manufacturing, these barriers are heightened by unannounced inspections of domestic manufacturers by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which are more frequent than such inspections at international facilities. Industry estimates suggest that building new manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals and critical inputs may take as long as 5 to 10 years, which is unacceptable from a national security standpoint. Even expanding existing capacity or modifying existing production lines to produce new or different products requires extensive permitting and regulatory approval, making it more difficult to repurpose existing underutilized pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity available domestically.</FP>\n                <FP>It is in the best interest of the Nation to eliminate regulatory barriers to the domestic production of the medicines Americans need.

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the International Criminal Court (ICC), as established by the Rome Statute, has engaged in illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel. The ICC has, without a legitimate basis, asserted jurisdiction over and opened preliminary investigations concerning personnel of the United States and certain of its allies, including Israel, and has further abused its power by issuing baseless arrest warrants targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant. The ICC has no jurisdiction over the United States or Israel, as neither country is party to the Rome Statute or a member of the ICC. Neither country has ever recognized the ICC's jurisdiction, and both nations are thriving democracies with militaries that strictly adhere to the laws of war. The ICC's recent actions against Israel and the United States set a dangerous precedent, directly endangering current and former United States personnel, including active service members of the Armed Forces, by exposing them to harassment, abuse, and possible arrest. This malign conduct in turn threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States Government and our allies, including Israel. Furthermore, in 2002, the Congress enacted the American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7421 \n                    <E T=\"03\">et seq.</E>\n                    ) to protect United States military personnel, United States officials, and officials and military personnel of certain allied countries against criminal prosecution by an international criminal court to which the United States is not party, stating, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of the United States to the risk of international criminal prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the President and other senior elected and appointed officials of the United States Government may be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (22 U.S.C. 7421(9)).\n                </FP>\n                <FP>The United States unequivocally opposes and expects our allies to oppose any ICC actions against the United States, Israel, or any other ally of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction. The United States remains committed to accountability and to the peaceful cultivation of international order, but the ICC and parties to the Rome Statute must respect the decisions of the United States and other countries not to subject their personnel to the ICC's jurisdiction, consistent with their respective sovereign prerogatives.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    The United States will impose tangible and significant consequences on those responsible for the ICC's transgressions, some of which may include the blocking of property and assets, as well as the suspension of entry into the United States of ICC officials, employees, and agents, as well as their immediate family members, as their entry into our Nation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"9370\"/>\n                </FP>\n                <FP>I therefore determine that any effort by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute protected persons, as defined in section 8(d) of this order, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to address that threat.

Section 2(g) of the Act defines \u00e2\u0080\u009cForeign Adversary Controlled Application\u00e2\u0080\u009d to include websites, desktop applications, mobile applications, and augmented or immersive technology applications operated directly or indirectly by ByteDance Ltd. or TikTok.

This timing also interferes with my ability to negotiate a resolution to avoid an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform while addressing national security concerns. Accordingly, I am instructing the Attorney General not to take any action to enforce the Act for a period of 75 days from today to allow my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                        . \n                        <E T=\"03\">Action.</E>\n                         (a) I hereby order the Attorney General not to take any action on behalf of the United States to enforce the Act for 75 days from the date of this order, to permit my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course of action with respect to TikTok.

A bedrock principle of the United States is that all citizens are treated equally under the law. This principle guarantees equality of opportunity, not equal outcomes. It promises that people are treated as individuals, not components of a particular race or group. It encourages meritocracy and a colorblind society, not race- or sex-based favoritism. Adherence to this principle is essential to creating opportunity, encouraging achievement, and sustaining the American Dream. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>But a pernicious movement endangers this foundational principle, seeking to transform America's promise of equal opportunity into a divisive pursuit of results preordained by irrelevant immutable characteristics, regardless of individual strengths, effort, or achievement. A key tool of this movement is disparate-impact liability, which holds that a near insurmountable presumption of unlawful discrimination exists where there are any differences in outcomes in certain circumstances among different races, sexes, or similar groups, even if there is no facially discriminatory policy or practice or discriminatory intent involved, and even if everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. Disparate-impact liability all but requires individuals and businesses to consider race and engage in racial balancing to avoid potentially crippling legal liability. It not only undermines our national values, but also runs contrary to equal protection under the law and, therefore, violates our Constitution. </FP>\n                <FP>On a practical level, disparate-impact liability has hindered businesses from making hiring and other employment decisions based on merit and skill, their needs, or the needs of their customers because of the specter that such a process might lead to disparate outcomes, and thus disparate-impact lawsuits. This has made it difficult, and in some cases impossible, for employers to use bona fide job-oriented evaluations when recruiting, which prevents job seekers from being paired with jobs to which their skills are most suited\u00e2\u0080\u0094in other words, it deprives them of opportunities for success. Because of disparate-impact liability, employers cannot act in the best interests of the job applicant, the employer, and the American public. </FP>\n                <FP>Disparate-impact liability imperils the effectiveness of civil rights laws by mandating, rather than proscribing, discrimination. As the Supreme Court put it, \u00e2\u0080\u009c[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</FP>\n                <FP>Disparate-impact liability is wholly inconsistent with the Constitution and threatens the commitment to merit and equality of opportunity that forms the foundation of the American Dream. Under my Administration, citizens will be treated equally before the law and as individuals, not consigned to a certain fate based on their immutable characteristics.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy</E>\n                    .

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the sustained influx of synthetic opioids has profound consequences on our Nation, including by killing approximately two hundred Americans per day, putting a severe strain on our healthcare system, ravaging our communities, and destroying our families. Synthetic opioid overdose is the leading cause of death for people aged 18 to 45 in the United States.</FP>\n                <FP>During my first term, I took steps to end the direct flow of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids from the People's Republic of China (PRC) to the United States. Since then, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which exerts ultimate control over the government and enterprises of the PRC, has subsidized and otherwise incentivized PRC chemical companies to export fentanyl and related precursor chemicals that are used to produce synthetic opioids sold illicitly in the United States.</FP>\n                <FP>Furthermore, the PRC provides support to and safe haven for PRC-origin transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) that launder the revenues from the production, shipment, and sale of illicit synthetic opioids. These PRC-origin TCOs coordinate and communicate using PRC social media software applications in the conduct of their business.</FP>\n                <FP>Many PRC-based chemical companies also go to great lengths to evade law enforcement and hide illicit substances in the flow of legitimate commerce. Some of the techniques employed by these PRC-based companies to conceal the true contents of the parcels and the identity of the distributors include the use of re-shippers in the United States, false invoices, fraudulent postage, and deceptive packaging. While more than 500,000 pounds of drugs have been seized at the southern border each of the last 3 fiscal years, in addition, more than 42,000 pounds of drugs have been seized at the northern border each year on average over the last 3 years. Illicit drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone.</FP>\n                <FP>The influx of these drugs to our Nation threatens the fabric of our society. The PRC plays a central role in this challenge, not merely by failing to stem the ultimate source of many illicit drugs distributed in the United States, but by actively sustaining and expanding the business of poisoning our citizens.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    The flow of contraband drugs like fentanyl to the United States through illicit distribution networks has created a national emergency, including a public health crisis in the United States, as outlined in the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy), Proclamation 10886 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border of the United States), and Executive Order 14157 of January 20, \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"9122\"/>\n                    2025 (Designating Cartels and Other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists).\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Despite multiple attempts to resolve this crisis at its root source through bilateral dialogue, PRC officials have failed to follow through with the decisive actions needed to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal cartels and shut down the money laundering TCOs. The PRC implements the most sophisticated domestic surveillance network coupled with the most comprehensive domestic law enforcement apparatus in the world. The PRC also routinely exerts extraterritorial reach across the globe to threaten, harass, and suppress what it views as political dissent. As such, the CCP does not lack the capacity to severely blunt the global illicit opioid epidemic; it simply is unwilling to do so.</FP>\n                <FP>Immediate action is required to address the national emergency I declared and to finally end this emergency, including the public health crisis caused by opioid use and addiction, which will not happen until the full compliance and cooperation of the PRC government is assured.</FP>\n                <FP>I hereby determine and order:</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Section 1</E>\n                    .

Pursuant to the NEA, I hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in that proclamation to cover the failure of the PRC government to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept chemical precursor suppliers, money launderers, other TCOs, criminals at large, and drugs. In addition, this failure to act constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. I hereby declare and reiterate a national emergency under the NEA and IEEPA to deal with that threat. This national emergency requires decisive and immediate action, and I have decided to impose, consistent with law, ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of the PRC as set forth in this order. In doing so, I invoke my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA, and specifically find that action under other authority to impose tariffs is inadequate to address this unusual and extraordinary threat.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    .

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the sustained influx of illicit opioids and other drugs has profound consequences on our Nation, endangering lives and putting a severe strain on our healthcare system, public services, and communities.</FP>\n                <FP>This challenge threatens the fabric of our society. Gang members, smugglers, human traffickers, and illicit drugs of all kinds have poured across our borders and into our communities. Canada has played a central role in these challenges, including by failing to devote sufficient attention and resources or meaningfully coordinate with United States law enforcement partners to effectively stem the tide of illicit drugs.</FP>\n                <FP>Drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) are the world's leading producers of fentanyl, methamphetamine, cocaine, and other illicit drugs, and they cultivate, process, and distribute massive quantities of narcotics that fuel addiction and violence in communities across the United States. These DTOs often collaborate with transnational cartels to smuggle illicit drugs into the United States, utilizing clandestine airstrips, maritime routes, and overland corridors.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    The challenges at our southern border are foremost in the public consciousness, but our northern border is not exempt from these issues. Criminal networks are implicated in human trafficking and smuggling operations, enabling unvetted illegal migration across our northern border. There is also a growing presence of Mexican cartels operating fentanyl and nitazene synthesis labs in Canada. The flow of illicit drugs like fentanyl to the United States through both illicit distribution networks and international mail\u00e2\u0080\u0094due, in the case of the latter, to the existing administrative exemption from duty and taxes, also known as \n                    <E T=\"03\">de minimis,</E>\n                     under section 1321 of title 19, United States Code\u00e2\u0080\u0094has created a public health crisis in the United States, as outlined in the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy) and Executive Order 14157 of January 20, 2025 (Designating Cartels and Other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists). With respect to smuggling of illicit drugs across our northern border, Canada's Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre recently published a study on the laundering of proceeds of illicit synthetic opioids, which recognized Canada's heightened domestic production of fentanyl, largely from British Columbia, and its growing footprint within international narcotics distribution. Despite a North American dialogue on the public health impacts of illicit drugs since 2016, Canadian officials have acknowledged that the problem has only grown. And while U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the Department of Homeland Security seized, comparatively, much less fentanyl from Canada than from Mexico last year, fentanyl is so potent that even a very small parcel of the drug can cause many deaths and \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"9114\"/>\n                    destruction to America families. In fact, the amount of fentanyl that crossed the northern border last year could kill 9.5 million Americans.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Immediate action is required to finally end this public health crisis and national emergency, which will not happen unless the compliance and cooperation of Canada is assured.</FP>\n                <FP>I hereby determine and order:</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Section 1</E>\n                    . (a) As President of the United States, my highest duty is the defense of the country and its citizens. A Nation without borders is not a nation at all. I will not stand by and allow our sovereignty to be eroded, our laws to be trampled, our citizens to be endangered, or our borders to be disrespected anymore.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>I previously declared a national emergency with respect to the grave threat to the United States posed by the influx of illegal aliens and illicit drugs into the United States in Proclamation 10886 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border). Pursuant to the NEA, I hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in that Proclamation to cover the threat to the safety and security of Americans, including the public health crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept DTOs, other drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs. In addition, this failure to act on the part of Canada constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. I hereby declare and reiterate a national emergency under the NEA and IEEPA to deal with that threat. This national emergency requires decisive and immediate action, and I have decided to impose, consistent with law, ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of Canada set forth in this order. In doing so, I invoke my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA, and specifically find that action under other authority to impose tariffs is inadequate to address this unusual and extraordinary threat.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    .

College athletics also provide substantial support to local economies and form an indelible part of family activities, pastimes, and culture in many communities.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>While major college football games can draw tens of millions of television viewers and attendees, they feature only a very small sample of the many athletes who benefit from the transformational opportunities that college athletics provide. Sixty-five percent of the 2024 United States Olympic Team members were current or former National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) varsity athletes, and approximately seventy-five percent were collegiate athletes. The 2024 United States Olympic Team earned 126 total medals, leading the overall medal count for the eighth consecutive Summer Olympic Games.</FP>\n                <FP>Beyond driving our unrivaled success in international competition, college athletes are more likely to report better outcomes in important respects during college and after graduation. A substantial majority of female executives at the largest American companies participated in sports during adolescence, many at the high school or collegiate level, and examples of business leaders and former Presidents who played college sports are legion. It is no exaggeration to say that America's system of collegiate athletics plays an integral role in forging the leaders that drive our Nation's success.</FP>\n                <FP>Yet the future of college sports is under unprecedented threat. Waves of recent litigation against collegiate athletics governing rules have eliminated limits on athlete compensation, pay-for-play recruiting inducements, and transfers between universities, unleashing a sea change that threatens the viability of college sports. While changes providing some increased benefits and flexibility to student-athletes were overdue and should be maintained, the inability to maintain reasonable rules and guardrails is a mortal threat to most college sports.</FP>\n                <FP>To illustrate, following a 2021 antitrust ruling from the United States Supreme Court striking down NCAA restrictions, the NCAA changed its rules to permit players to receive compensation for their name, image, and likeness (NIL) from third parties. But guardrails designed to ensure that these were legitimate, market-value NIL payments for endorsements or similar services, rather than simply pay-for-play inducements, were eliminated through litigation. Other limits on player transfers among schools were also taken down through litigation.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    This has created an out-of-control, rudderless system in which competing university donors engage in bidding wars for the best players, who can change teams each season. Meanwhile, more than 30 States have passed their own NIL laws in a chaotic race to the bottom, sometimes to gain temporary competitive advantages for their major collegiate teams. As a result, players at some universities will receive more than $50 million per year, mostly for the revenue-generating sports like football. Entering the 2024 season, players on the eventual college football national champion \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"35822\"/>\n                    team were being paid around $20 million annually. By the 2025 season, football players at one university will reportedly be paid $35-40 million, with revenue-sharing included.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>This not only reduces competition and parity by creating an oligarchy of teams that can simply buy the best players\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the best players from less-wealthy programs at the end of each season\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the imperative that university donors must devote ever-escalating resources to compete in the revenue-generating sports like football and basketball siphons away the resources necessary to support the panoply of non-revenue sports. Absent guardrails to stop the madness and ensure a reasonable, balanced use of resources across collegiate athletic programs that preserves their educational and developmental benefits, many college sports will soon cease to exist.</FP>\n                <FP>A national solution is urgently needed to prevent this situation from deteriorating beyond repair and to protect non-revenue sports, including many women's sports, that comprise the backbone of intercollegiate athletics, drive American superiority at the Olympics and other international competitions, and catalyze hundreds of thousands of student-athletes to fuel American success in myriad ways.</FP>\n                <FP>Attempting to create some guardrails and shelter from litigation, colleges have adopted a new regime, deciding to pay athletes directly and simultaneously limit the total number of athletes on their campuses. Given that the new roster limits, by exceeding the scholarship limits they replace, will increase the potential number of scholarships available in many sports, this opportunity must be utilized to strengthen and expand non-revenue sports. Simultaneously, the third-party market of pay-for-play inducements must be eliminated before its insatiable demand for resources dries up support for non-revenue sports. Otherwise, a crucial American asset will be lost.</FP>\n                <FP>It is the policy of my Administration that all college sports should be preserved and, where possible, expanded. My Administration will therefore provide the stability, fairness, and balance necessary to protect student-athletes, collegiate athletic scholarships and opportunities, and the special American institution of college sports.

In Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I found that conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States that has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States. I declared a national emergency with respect to that threat, and to deal with that threat, I imposed additional \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>I have received additional information and recommendations from various senior officials on, among other things, the continued lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships and the impact of foreign trading partners' disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers on U.S. exports, the domestic manufacturing base, critical supply chains, and the defense industrial base. I also have received additional information and recommendations on foreign relations, economic, and national security matters, including the status of trade negotiations, efforts to retaliate against the United States for its actions to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, and efforts to align with the United States on economic and national security matters.</FP>\n                <FP>For example, some trading partners have agreed to, or are on the verge of agreeing to, meaningful trade and security commitments with the United States, thus signaling their sincere intentions to permanently remedy the trade barriers that have contributed to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, and to align with the United States on economic and national security matters. Other trading partners, despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered terms that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national-security matters. There are also some trading partners that have failed to engage in negotiations with the United States or to take adequate steps to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    After considering the information and recommendations that I have recently received, among other things, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 by imposing additional \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     duties on goods of certain trading partners at the rates set forth in Annex I to this order, subject to all applicable exceptions set forth in Executive Order 14257, as amended, in lieu of the additional \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     duties previously imposed on goods of such trading partners in Executive Order 14257, as amended.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Tariff Modifications</E>\n                    . (a) The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) shall be modified as provided in Annex II to this order. These modifications shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"37964\"/>\n                    after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order, except that goods loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order, and entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on October 5, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty and shall instead remain subject to the additional \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     duties previously imposed in Executive Order 14257, as amended.\n                </FP>\n                <P>\n                    (b) Certain foreign trading partners identified in Annex I to this order have agreed to, or are on the verge of concluding, meaningful trade and security agreements with the United States.

For a good of the European Union with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is less than 15 percent, the sum of its Column 1 Duty Rate and the additional \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be 15 percent. For a good of the European Union with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is at least 15 percent, the additional \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be zero.\n                </P>\n                <P>\n                    (d) Goods of any foreign trading partner that is not listed in Annex I to this order will be subject to an additional \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     rate of duty of 10 percent pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 14257, as amended, unless otherwise expressly provided. This rate shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order.\n                </P>\n                <P>(e) The HTSUS shall also be modified by continuing to suspend headings 9903.01.43 through 9903.01.62 and 9903.01.64 through 9903.01.76, and subdivisions (v)(xiii)(1)-(9) and (11)-(57) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, until the effective date of the modifications provided in Annex II to this order.

The Federal Government processes trillions of dollars annually in disbursements to individuals, businesses, and organizations, and in receipts from taxes, fees, and other payments to finance daily and long-term Government operations. These transactions flow into and out of the United States General Fund (General Fund), which might be thought of as America's bank account. In Fiscal Year 2024, $33.9 trillion flowed into the General Fund and $33.6 trillion flowed out of the account, including $5.87 trillion (less net interest) in benefits, grants, loans, vendor payments, and other disbursements.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>The Department of the Treasury is the largest financial payment manager of the Federal Government and is responsible for safeguarding the General Fund, but lacks sufficient controls to track transactions flowing through the General Fund to determine if they were proper. To enforce sufficient controls and ensure accountability to American taxpayers, the Department of the Treasury requires financial information from executive departments and agencies (agencies) beyond what they currently provide.</FP>\n                <FP>Financial fraud threatens the integrity of Federal programs and undermines trust in Government. Agencies' past underinvestment in technology and longstanding challenges with access to accurate data has prevented them from more fully safeguarding taxpayer dollars against fraud and improper payments. The Government Accountability Office estimates that the Federal Government loses between $233 and $521 billion annually to fraud.</FP>\n                <FP>In addition to being an efficient steward of taxpayer funds, the Federal Government, on behalf of the American public, must seek to ensure that financial information is accurate and that there is transparency with respect to how taxpayer dollars are being used. Today, Federal funds are disbursed both by the Department of the Treasury and various Federal Government entities that are authorized to issue their own disbursements known as Non-Treasury Disbursing Offices (NTDOs). In Fiscal Year 2024, NTDOs were estimated to be responsible for 181 million payments totaling over $1.5 trillion (approximately 22 percent of all Federal Government dollars disbursed). This fragmentation of disbursing authority, together with the proliferation of non-standard financial management systems across the Federal Government, leads to expensive, disjointed, and duplicative financial reporting, lack of financial traceability, complicated financial management, opacity, increased operational risks, and decreased ability of the Department of the Treasury to provide centralized oversight.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    This order promotes financial integrity by enabling the Department of the Treasury to more easily conduct improper payment and fraud prevention screening prior to disbursing funds on behalf of agencies. This order increases transparency and accountability by requiring agencies to provide the Department of the Treasury with the information needed to track transactions through the General Fund in greater detail.

Abundant energy is a vital national- and economic-security interest. In conjunction with domestic fossil fuel production, nuclear energy can liberate America from dependence on geopolitical rivals. It can power not only traditional manufacturing industries but also cutting-edge, energy-intensive industries such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Between 1954 and 1978, the United States authorized the construction of 133 since-completed civilian nuclear reactors at 81 power plants. Since 1978, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has authorized only a fraction of that number; of these, only two reactors have entered into commercial operation. The NRC charges applicants by the hour to process license applications, with prolonged timelines that maximize fees while throttling nuclear power development. The NRC has failed to license new reactors even as technological advances promise to make nuclear power safer, cheaper, more adaptable, and more abundant than ever.</FP>\n                <FP>This failure stems from a fundamental error: Instead of efficiently promoting safe, abundant nuclear energy, the NRC has instead tried to insulate Americans from the most remote risks without appropriate regard for the severe domestic and geopolitical costs of such risk aversion. The NRC utilizes safety models that posit there is no safe threshold of radiation exposure and that harm is directly proportional to the amount of exposure. Those models lack sound scientific basis and produce irrational results, such as requiring that nuclear plants protect against radiation below naturally occurring levels. A myopic policy of minimizing even trivial risks ignores the reality that substitute forms of energy production also carry risk, such as pollution with potentially deleterious health effects.</FP>\n                <FP>Recent events in Europe, such as the nationwide blackouts in Spain and Portugal, underscore the importance of my Administration's focus on dispatchable power generation\u00e2\u0080\u0094including nuclear power\u00e2\u0080\u0094over intermittent power. Beginning today, my Administration will reform the NRC, including its structure, personnel, regulations, and basic operations. In so doing, we will produce lasting American dominance in the global nuclear energy market, create tens of thousands of high-paying jobs, and generate American-led prosperity and resilience.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy</E>\n                    .

The NRC, working with its DOGE Team, the Office of Management and Budget, and other executive departments and agencies as appropriate, shall undertake a review and wholesale revision of its regulations and guidance documents, and issue notice(s) of proposed rulemaking effecting this revision within 9 months of the date of this order. The NRC shall issue final rules and guidance to conclude this revision process within 18 months of the date of this order. In conducting this wholesale revision, the NRC shall be guided by the policies set forth in section 2 of this order and shall in particular:\n                </FP>\n                <P>\n                    (a) Establish fixed deadlines for its evaluation and approval of licenses, license amendments, license renewals, certificates of compliance, power uprates, license transfers, and any other activity requested by a licensee or potential licensee, as directed under the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act, rather than the nonbinding \u00e2\u0080\u009cgeneric milestone schedules\u00e2\u0080\u009d guidelines the NRC has already adopted. Those deadlines shall be enforced by fixed caps on the NRC's recovery of hourly fees.

The regulations should not provide for tolling those deadlines except in instances of applicant failure, and must allow a reasonably diligent applicant to navigate the licensing process successfully in the time allotted. Moreover, these are maximum time periods; the NRC shall adopt shorter deadlines tailored to particular reactor types or licensing pathways as appropriate.\n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"22589\"/>\n                </P>\n                <P>(b) Adopt science-based radiation limits.

Section 117 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, 20 U.S.C. 1011f, requires institutions of higher education to report significant sources of foreign funding. But, because section 117 has not been robustly enforced, the true amounts, sources, and purposes of foreign money flowing to American campuses are unknown. From 2010 to 2016, according to one study, universities failed to disclose more than half of reportable foreign gifts. Even when foreign funding is reported, its true sources are often hidden. Protecting American educational, cultural, and national security interests requires transparency regarding foreign funds flowing to American higher education and research institutions. During my first term, the Department of Education opened investigations on 19 campuses from 2019-2021, which led universities to report $6.5 billion in previously undisclosed foreign funds. Yet the prior administration undid this work, moving the Department of Education's specialized investigatory work on foreign funds to a unit ill-equipped to perform it, undermining investigations, and hindering public access to information on foreign gifts and contracts. It is the policy of my Administration to end the secrecy surrounding foreign funds in American educational institutions, protect the marketplace of ideas from propaganda sponsored by foreign governments, and safeguard America's students and research from foreign exploitation.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Robust Enforcement to Prevent Harm to American Interests</E>\n                    .

India and Brazil, for example, are tying voter identification to a biometric database, while the United States largely relies on self-attestation for citizenship. In tabulating votes, Germany and Canada require use of paper ballots, counted in public by local officials, which substantially reduces the number of disputes as compared to the American patchwork of voting methods that can lead to basic chain-of-custody problems. Further, while countries like Denmark and Sweden sensibly limit mail-in voting to those unable to vote in person and do not count late-arriving votes regardless of the date of postmark, many American elections now feature mass voting by mail, with many officials accepting ballots without postmarks or those received well after Election Day. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>Free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional Republic. The right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election.</FP>\n                <FP>Under the Constitution, State governments must safeguard American elections in compliance with Federal laws that protect Americans' voting rights and guard against dilution by illegal voting, discrimination, fraud, and other forms of malfeasance and error. Yet the United States has not adequately enforced Federal election requirements that, for example, prohibit States from counting ballots received after Election Day or prohibit non-citizens from registering to vote.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    Federal law establishes a uniform Election Day across the Nation for Federal elections, 2 U.S.C. 7 and 3 U.S.C. 1. It is the policy of my Administration to enforce those statutes and require that votes be cast and received by the election date established in law. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recently held in \n                    <E T=\"03\">Republican National Committee</E>\n                     v. \n                    <E T=\"03\">Wetzel</E>\n                     (2024), those statutes set \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe day by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet numerous States fail to comply with those laws by counting ballots received after Election Day. This is like allowing persons who arrive 3 days after Election Day, perhaps after a winner has been declared, to vote in person at a former voting precinct, which would be absurd. Several Federal laws, including 18 U.S.C. 1015 and 611, prohibit foreign nationals from registering to vote or voting in Federal elections. Yet States fail adequately to vet voters' citizenship, and, in recent years, the Department of Justice has failed to prioritize and devote sufficient resources for enforcement of these provisions. Even worse, the prior administration actively prevented States from removing aliens from their voter lists. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    Additionally, Federal laws, such as the National Voter Registration Act (Pub. L. 103-31) and the Help America Vote Act (Pub. L. 107-252), require States to maintain an accurate and current Statewide list of every legally registered voter in the State. And the Department of Homeland Security is required to share database information with States upon request so they \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"14006\"/>\n                    can fulfill this duty. See 8 U.S.C. 1373(c). Maintaining accurate voter registration lists is a fundamental requirement in protecting voters from having their ballots voided or diluted by fraudulent votes. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>Federal law, 52 U.S.C. 30121, prohibits foreign nationals from participating in Federal, State, or local elections by making any contributions or expenditures. But foreign nationals and non-governmental organizations have taken advantage of loopholes in the law's interpretation, spending millions of dollars through conduit contributions and ballot-initiative-related expenditures. This type of foreign interference in our election process undermines the franchise and the right of American citizens to govern their Republic. </FP>\n                <FP>Above all, elections must be honest and worthy of the public trust. That requires voting methods that produce a voter-verifiable paper record allowing voters to efficiently check their votes to protect against fraud or mistake. Election-integrity standards must be modified accordingly.</FP>\n                <FP>It is the policy of my Administration to enforce Federal law and to protect the integrity of our election process.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\"> Enforcing the Citizenship Requirement for Federal Elections.</E>\n                     To enforce the Federal prohibition on foreign nationals voting in Federal elections:\n                </FP>\n                <P>(a)(i) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Election Assistance Commission shall take appropriate action to require, in its national mail voter registration form issued under 52 U.S.C. 20508:</P>\n                <P SOURCE=\"P1\">(A) documentary proof of United States citizenship, consistent with 52 U.S.C. 20508(b)(3); and</P>\n                <P SOURCE=\"P1\">(B) a State or local official to record on the form the type of document that the applicant presented as documentary proof of United States citizenship, including the date of the document's issuance, the date of the document's expiration (if any), the office that issued the document, and any unique identification number associated with the document as required by the criteria in 52 U.S.C. 21083(a)(5)(A), while taking appropriate measures to ensure information security.</P>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(ii) For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdocumentary proof of United States citizenship\u00e2\u0080\u009d shall include a copy of: </FP>\n                <P SOURCE=\"P1\">(A) a United States passport; </P>\n                <P SOURCE=\"P1\">(B) an identification document compliant with the requirements of the REAL ID Act of 2005 (Pub.

The plain text of Federal law, including the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193) (PRWORA), generally prohibits illegal aliens from obtaining most taxpayer-funded benefits. Title IV of the PRWORA states that it is national policy that \u00e2\u0080\u009caliens within the Nation's borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that \u00e2\u0080\u009c[i]t is a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But in the decades since the passage of the PRWORA, numerous administrations have acted to undermine the principles and limitations directed by the Congress through that law. Over the last 4 years, in particular, the prior administration repeatedly undercut the goals of that law, resulting in the improper expenditure of significant taxpayer resources. My Administration will uphold the rule of law, defend against the waste of hard-earned taxpayer resources, and protect benefits for American citizens in need, including individuals with disabilities and veterans. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Preserving Federal Public Benefits</E>\n                    .

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that underlying conditions, including a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners' economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption, as indicated by large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States. That threat has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States in the domestic economic policies of key trading partners and structural imbalances in the global trading system. I hereby declare a national emergency with respect to this threat.</FP>\n                    <FP>On January 20, 2025, I signed the America First Trade Policy Presidential Memorandum directing my Administration to investigate the causes of our country's large and persistent annual trade deficits in goods, including the economic and national security implications and risks resulting from such deficits, and to undertake a review of, and identify, any unfair trade practices by other countries. On February 13, 2025, I signed a Presidential Memorandum entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cReciprocal Trade and Tariffs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that directed further review of our trading partners' non-reciprocal trading practices, and noted the relationship between non-reciprocal practices and the trade deficit. On April 1, 2025, I received the final results of those investigations, and I am taking action today based on those results.</FP>\n                    <FP>Large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits have led to the hollowing out of our manufacturing base; inhibited our ability to scale advanced domestic manufacturing capacity; undermined critical supply chains; and rendered our defense-industrial base dependent on foreign adversaries. Large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits are caused in substantial part by a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships. This situation is evidenced by disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers that make it harder for U.S. manufacturers to sell their products in foreign markets. It is also evidenced by the economic policies of key U.S. trading partners insofar as they suppress domestic wages and consumption, and thereby demand for U.S. exports, while artificially increasing the competitiveness of their goods in global markets. These conditions have given rise to the national emergency that this order is intended to abate and resolve.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        For decades starting in 1934, U.S. trade policy has been organized around the principle of reciprocity. The Congress directed the President to secure reduced reciprocal tariff rates from key trading partners first through bilateral trade agreements and later under the auspices of the global trading system. Between 1934 and 1945, the executive branch negotiated and signed 32 bilateral reciprocal trade agreements designed to lower tariff rates on a \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"15042\"/>\n                        reciprocal basis. After 1947 through 1994, participating countries engaged in eight rounds of negotiation, which resulted in the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and seven subsequent tariff reduction rounds.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>However, despite a commitment to the principle of reciprocity, the trading relationship between the United States and its trading partners has become highly unbalanced, particularly in recent years. The post-war international economic system was based upon three incorrect assumptions: first, that if the United States led the world in liberalizing tariff and non-tariff barriers the rest of the world would follow; second, that such liberalization would ultimately result in more economic convergence and increased domestic consumption among U.S. trading partners converging towards the share in the United States; and third, that as a result, the United States would not accrue large and persistent goods trade deficits.</FP>\n                    <FP>This framework set in motion events, agreements, and commitments that did not result in reciprocity or generally increase domestic consumption in foreign economies relative to domestic consumption in the United States. Those events, in turn, created large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits as a feature of the global trading system.</FP>\n                    <FP>Put simply, while World Trade Organization (WTO) Members agreed to bind their tariff rates on a most-favored-nation (MFN) basis, and thereby provide their best tariff rates to all WTO Members, they did not agree to bind their tariff rates at similarly low levels or to apply tariff rates on a reciprocal basis. Consequently, according to the WTO, the United States has among the lowest simple average MFN tariff rates in the world at 3.3 percent, while many of our key trading partners like Brazil (11.2 percent), China (7.5 percent), the European Union (EU) (5 percent), India (17 percent), and Vietnam (9.4 percent) have simple average MFN tariff rates that are significantly higher.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        Moreover, these average MFN tariff rates conceal much larger discrepancies across economies in tariff rates applied to particular products. For example, the United States imposes a 2.5 percent tariff on passenger vehicle imports (with internal combustion engines), while the European Union (10 percent), India (70 percent), and China (15 percent) impose much higher duties on the same product. For network switches and routers, the United States imposes a 0 percent tariff, but for similar products, India (10 percent) levies a higher rate. Brazil (18 percent) and Indonesia (30 percent) impose a higher tariff on ethanol than does the United States (2.5 percent). For rice in the husk, the U.S. MFN tariff is 2.7 percent (\n                        <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                         equivalent), while India (80 percent), Malaysia (40 percent), and Turkey (an average of 31 percent) impose higher rates. Apples enter the United States duty-free, but not so in Turkey (60.3 percent) and India (50 percent).\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>Similarly, non-tariff barriers also deprive U.S. manufacturers of reciprocal access to markets around the world. The 2025 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers (NTE) details a great number of non-tariff barriers to U.S. exports around the world on a trading-partner by trading-partner basis. These barriers include import barriers and licensing restrictions; customs barriers and shortcomings in trade facilitation; technical barriers to trade (e.g., unnecessarily trade restrictive standards, conformity assessment procedures, or technical regulations); sanitary and phytosanitary measures that unnecessarily restrict trade without furthering safety objectives; inadequate patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark regimes and inadequate enforcement of intellectual property rights; discriminatory licensing requirements or regulatory standards; barriers to cross-border data flows and discriminatory practices affecting trade in digital products; investment barriers; subsidies; anticompetitive practices; discrimination in favor of domestic state-owned enterprises, and failures by governments in protecting labor and environment standards; bribery; and corruption.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        Moreover, non-tariff barriers include the domestic economic policies and practices of our trading partners, including currency practices and value-added taxes, and their associated market distortions, that suppress domestic \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"15043\"/>\n                        consumption and boost exports to the United States. This lack of reciprocity is apparent in the fact that the share of consumption to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the United States is about 68 percent, but it is much lower in others like Ireland (27 percent), Singapore (31 percent), China (39 percent), South Korea (49 percent), and Germany (50 percent).\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>At the same time, efforts by the United States to address these imbalances have stalled. Trading partners have repeatedly blocked multilateral and plurilateral solutions, including in the context of new rounds of tariff negotiations and efforts to discipline non-tariff barriers. At the same time, with the U.S. economy disproportionately open to imports, U.S. trading partners have had few incentives to provide reciprocal treatment to U.S. exports in the context of bilateral trade negotiations.</FP>\n                    <FP>These structural asymmetries have driven the large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficit. Even for countries with which the United States may enjoy an occasional bilateral trade surplus, the accumulation of tariff and non-tariff barriers on U.S. exports may make that surplus smaller than it would have been without such barriers. Permitting these asymmetries to continue is not sustainable in today's economic and geopolitical environment because of the effect they have on U.S. domestic production. A nation's ability to produce domestically is the bedrock of its national and economic security.</FP>\n                    <FP>Both my first Administration in 2017, and the Biden Administration in 2022, recognized that increasing domestic manufacturing is critical to U.S. national security. According to 2023 United Nations data, U.S. manufacturing output as a share of global manufacturing output was 17.4 percent, down from a peak in 2001 of 28.4 percent.</FP>\n                    <FP>Over time, the persistent decline in U.S. manufacturing output has reduced U.S. manufacturing capacity. The need to maintain robust and resilient domestic manufacturing capacity is particularly acute in certain advanced industrial sectors like automobiles, shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, technology products, machine tools, and basic and fabricated metals, because once competitors gain sufficient global market share in these sectors, U.S. production could be permanently weakened. It is also critical to scale manufacturing capacity in the defense-industrial sector so that we can manufacture the defense materiel and equipment necessary to protect American interests at home and abroad.</FP>\n                    <FP>In fact, because the United States has supplied so much military equipment to other countries, U.S. stockpiles of military goods are too low to be compatible with U.S. national defense interests. Furthermore, U.S. defense companies must develop new, advanced manufacturing technologies across a range of critical sectors including bio-manufacturing, batteries, and microelectronics. If the United States wishes to maintain an effective security umbrella to defend its citizens and homeland, as well as for its allies and partners, it needs to have a large upstream manufacturing and goods-producing ecosystem to manufacture these products without undue reliance on imports for key inputs.</FP>\n                    <FP>Increased reliance on foreign producers for goods also has compromised U.S. economic security by rendering U.S. supply chains vulnerable to geopolitical disruption and supply shocks. In recent years, the vulnerability of the U.S. economy in this respect was exposed both during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Americans had difficulty accessing essential products, as well as when the Houthi rebels later began attacking cargo ships in the Middle East.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        The decline of U.S. manufacturing capacity threatens the U.S. economy in other ways, including through the loss of manufacturing jobs. From 1997 to 2024, the United States lost around 5 million manufacturing jobs and experienced one of the largest drops in manufacturing employment in history. Furthermore, many manufacturing job losses were concentrated in specific geographical areas. In these areas, the loss of manufacturing jobs contributed \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"15044\"/>\n                        to the decline in rates of family formation and to the rise of other social trends, like the abuse of opioids, that have imposed profound costs on the U.S. economy.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>The future of American competitiveness depends on reversing these trends. Today, manufacturing represents just 11 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, yet it accounts for 35 percent of American productivity growth and 60 percent of our exports. Importantly, U.S. manufacturing is the main engine of innovation in the United States, responsible for 55 percent of all patents and 70 percent of all research and development (R&amp;D) spending. The fact that R&amp;D expenditures by U.S. multinational enterprises in China grew at an average rate of 13.6 percent a year between 2003 and 2017, while their R&amp;D expenditures in the United States grew by an average of just 5 percent per year during the same time period, is evidence of the strong link between manufacturing and innovation. Furthermore, every manufacturing job spurs 7 to 12 new jobs in other related industries, helping to build and sustain our economy.</FP>\n                    <FP>Just as a nation that does not produce manufactured products cannot maintain the industrial base it needs for national security, neither can a nation long survive if it cannot produce its own food. Presidential Policy Directive 21 of February 12, 2013 (Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience), designates food and agriculture as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccritical infrastructure sector\u00e2\u0080\u009d because it is one of the sectors considered \u00e2\u0080\u009cso vital to the United States that [its] incapacity or destruction . . . would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Furthermore, when I left office, the United States had a trade surplus in agricultural products, but today, that surplus has vanished. Eviscerated by a slew of new non-tariff barriers imposed by our trading partners, it has been replaced by a projected $49 billion annual agricultural trade deficit.</FP>\n                    <FP>For these reasons, I hereby declare and order:</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        <E T=\"04\">Section 1</E>\n                        . \n                        <E T=\"03\">National Emergency.</E>\n                         As President of the United States, my highest duty is ensuring the national and economic security of the country and its citizens.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>I have declared a national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, which have grown by over 40 percent in the past 5 years alone, reaching $1.2 trillion in 2024. This trade deficit reflects asymmetries in trade relationships that have contributed to the atrophy of domestic production capacity, especially that of the U.S. manufacturing and defense-industrial base. These asymmetries also impact U.S. producers' ability to export and, consequentially, their incentive to produce.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        Specifically, such asymmetry includes not only non-reciprocal differences in tariff rates among foreign trading partners, but also extensive use of non-tariff barriers by foreign trading partners, which reduce the competitiveness of U.S. exports while artificially enhancing the competitiveness of their own goods. These non-tariff barriers include technical barriers to trade; non-scientific sanitary and phytosanitary rules; inadequate intellectual property protections; suppressed domestic consumption (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         wage suppression); weak labor, environmental, and other regulatory standards and protections; and corruption. These non-tariff barriers give rise to significant imbalances even when the United States and a trading partner have comparable tariff rates.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        The cumulative effect of these imbalances has been the transfer of resources from domestic producers to foreign firms, reducing opportunities for domestic manufacturers to expand and, in turn, leading to lost manufacturing jobs, diminished manufacturing capacity, and an atrophied industrial base, including in the defense-industrial sector. At the same time, foreign firms are better positioned to scale production, reinvest in innovation, and compete \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"15045\"/>\n                        in the global economy, to the detriment of U.S. economic and national security.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>The absence of sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity in certain critical and advanced industrial sectors\u00e2\u0080\u0094another outcome of the large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits\u00e2\u0080\u0094also compromises U.S. economic and national security by rendering the U.S. economy less resilient to supply chain disruption. Finally, the large, persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, and the concomitant loss of industrial capacity, have compromised military readiness; this vulnerability can only be redressed through swift corrective action to rebalance the flow of imports into the United States. Such impact upon military readiness and our national security posture is especially acute with the recent rise in armed conflicts abroad. I call upon the public and private sector to make the efforts necessary to strengthen the international economic position of the United States.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                        . \n                        <E T=\"03\">Reciprocal Tariff Policy.</E>\n                         It is the policy of the United States to rebalance global trade flows by imposing an additional \n                        <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                         duty on all imports from all trading partners except as otherwise provided herein.

It is this spirit that illuminated the world with Edison's lightbulb, carried the Wright brothers into the skies, and sent Armstrong to the moon. Today, a new frontier of scientific discovery lies before us, defined by transformative technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced biotechnology. Breakthroughs in these fields have the potential to reshape the global balance of power, spark entirely new industries, and revolutionize the way we live and work. As our global competitors race to exploit these technologies, it is a national security imperative for the United States to achieve and maintain unquestioned and unchallenged global technological dominance. To secure our future, we must harness the full power of American innovation by empowering entrepreneurs, unleashing private-sector creativity, and reinvigorating our research institutions.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>At the heart of scientific progress lies the pursuit of truth. But this foundational principle, which has driven every major breakthrough in our history, is increasingly under threat. Today, across science, medicine, and technology, ideological dogmas have surfaced that elevate group identity above individual achievement, enforce conformity at the expense of innovative ideas, and inject politics into the heart of the scientific method. These agendas have not only distorted truth but have eroded public trust, undermined the integrity of research, stifled innovation, and weakened America's competitive edge. This order establishes the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to unite the brightest minds from academia, industry, and government to guide our Nation through this critical moment by charting a path forward for American leadership in science and technology.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Establishment.</E>\n                     (a) There is hereby established the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).\n                </FP>\n                <P>(b) The PCAST shall be composed of not more than 24 members.

This industry plays a vital role in key downstream civilian industries, including construction. The United States faces significant vulnerabilities in the wood supply chain from imported timber, lumber, and their derivative products being dumped onto the United States market.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>The United States has ample timber resources. The current United States softwood lumber industry has the practical production capacity to supply 95 percent of the United States' 2024 softwood consumption. Yet, since 2016 the United States has been a net importer of lumber.</FP>\n                <FP>Wood products are a key input used by both the civilian construction industry and the military. Each year, the United States military spends over 10 billion dollars on construction. The military also invests in innovative building material technology, including processes to create innovative wood products such as cross-laminated timber. The procurement of these building materials depends on a strong domestic lumber industry and a manufacturing base capable of meeting both military-specific and wider civilian needs.</FP>\n                <FP>It is the policy of the United States to ensure reliable, secure, and resilient domestic supply chains of timber, lumber, and their derivative products.

For far too long, prices were hidden from patients and employers, with inadequate recourse available to individuals looking to shop for care or obtain pricing information from a healthcare provider in advance of a visit or procedure. These opaque pricing arrangements allowed powerful entities, such as hospitals and insurance companies, to operate with insufficient accountability regarding their pricing practices, resulting in patients, employers, and taxpayers shouldering the burden of inflated healthcare costs.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Pursuant to Executive Order 13877 of June 24, 2019 (Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First), my Administration issued paradigm-shifting regulations to put patients first by requiring hospitals and health plans to deliver meaningful price information to the American people. These regulations require hospitals to maintain a consumer-friendly display of pricing information for up to 300 shoppable services and a machine-readable file with negotiated rates for every single service the hospital provides; health plans to post their negotiated rates with providers as well as their out-of-network payments to providers and the actual prices they or their pharmacy benefit manager pay for prescription drugs; and health plans to maintain a consumer-facing internet tool through which individuals can access price information.</FP>\n                <FP>One economic analysis from 2023 estimated the impact of these regulations, if fully implemented, could result in as much as $80 billion in healthcare savings for consumers, employers, and insurers by 2025. Another report from 2024 suggested healthcare price transparency could help employers reduce healthcare costs by 27 percent across 500 common healthcare services. Recent data has found the top 25 percent of most expensive healthcare service prices have dropped by 6.3 percent per year following the initial implementation of price transparency during my first term.</FP>\n                <FP>Unfortunately, progress on price transparency at the Federal level has stalled since the end of my first term. Hospitals and health plans were not adequately held to account when their price transparency data was incomplete or not even posted at all. The Biden Administration failed to take sufficient steps to fully enforce my Administration's requirement that would end the opaque nature of drug prices by ensuring health plans publicly post the true prices they pay for prescription drugs.</FP>\n                <FP>The American people deserve better. Making America healthy again will require empowering individuals with the best information possible to inform their life and healthcare choices. By building on the historic efforts of my first term, my Administration will make more meaningful price information available to patients to support a more competitive, innovative, affordable, and higher quality healthcare system.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy.</E>\n                     It is the policy of the United States to put patients first and ensure they have the information they need to make well-informed \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"11006\"/>\n                    healthcare decisions.

Despite the magnitude of their impact, these measures are often difficult for the average person or business to understand, as they require synthesizing the collective meaning not just of formal regulations but also rules, memoranda, administrative orders, guidance documents, policy statements, and interagency agreements that are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, further increasing compliance costs and the risk of costs of non-compliance. It is the policy of my Administration to significantly reduce the private expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations to secure America's economic prosperity and national security and the highest possible quality of life for each citizen. To that end, it is important that for each new regulation issued, at least 10 prior regulations be identified for elimination.

Land-use restrictions have stripped hunters, fishers, hikers, and outdoorsmen of access to public lands that belong to them.

Despite these challenges, our Nation has proven that conservation and economic growth go hand in hand. Since the signing of the Great American Outdoors Act (Public Law 116-152), the outdoor recreation economy has grown to $1.2 trillion in economic output, and, in 2023, comprised 3.1 percent of employees in the United States and supported 5 million jobs.</FP>\n                <FP>Through both innovation and commonsense policies, America can preserve its natural beauty and expand outdoor recreation opportunities for future generations.

Crime is out of control in the District of Columbia. Washington, District of Columbia, is our Nation's capital and home to the central institutions of American governance. Yet rising violence in the capital now urgently endangers public servants, citizens, and tourists, disrupts safe and secure transportation and the proper functioning of the Federal Government, and forces the diversion of critical public resources toward emergency response and security measures. The city government's failure to maintain public order and safety has had a dire impact on the Federal Government's ability to operate efficiently to address the Nation's broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>The increase in violent crime in the heart of our Republic has consequences beyond the individual tragedies that have dominated media coverage. Such lawlessness also poses intolerable risks to the vital Federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia. Violence and crime hamper the recruitment and retention of essential Federal employees, undermine critical functions of Government and thus the well-being of the entire Nation, and erode confidence in the strength of the United States. These conditions are disgraceful anywhere, but particularly in the capital of our Nation and the seat of the Federal Government. Citizens, tourists, and Federal workers deserve peace and security, not fear and violence. The smooth functioning of executive departments and agencies, courts, diplomatic missions, and the Federal Government demands an effective law-enforcement mechanism capable of halting the precipitous rise in violent crime, not one that permits Government workers to be violently attacked by mobs or fatally shot close to the Federal buildings where they work.</FP>\n                    <FP>The magnitude of the violent crime crisis places the District of Columbia among the most violent jurisdictions in the United States. In 2024, the District of Columbia averaged one of the highest robbery and murder rates of large cities nationwide. Indeed, the District of Columbia now has a higher violent crime, murder, and robbery rate than all 50 States, recording a homicide rate in 2024 of 27.54 per 100,000 residents. It also experienced the Nation's highest vehicle theft rate with 842.4 thefts per 100,000 residents\u00e2\u0080\u0094over three times the national average of 250.2 thefts per 100,000 residents. The District of Columbia is, by some measures, among the top 20 percent of the most dangerous cities in the world.</FP>\n                    <FP>As President, I have a solemn duty to take care that our laws are faithfully executed, and a sacred responsibility to protect the safety and security of United States citizens who live in and visit our Nation's capital, including Federal workers who live or commute into the District of Columbia.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the modern world, driving innovation across industries, enhancing productivity, and reshaping the way we live and work. To ensure the United States remains a global leader in this technological revolution, we must provide our Nation's youth with opportunities to cultivate the skills and understanding necessary to use and create the next generation of AI technology. By fostering AI competency, we will equip our students with the foundational knowledge and skills necessary to adapt to and thrive in an increasingly digital society. Early learning and exposure to AI concepts not only demystifies this powerful technology but also sparks curiosity and creativity, preparing students to become active and responsible participants in the workforce of the future and nurturing the next generation of American AI innovators to propel our Nation to new heights of scientific and economic achievement.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>To achieve this vision, we must also invest in our educators and equip them with the tools and knowledge to not only train students about AI, but also to utilize AI in their classrooms to improve educational outcomes. Professional development programs focused on AI education will empower educators to confidently guide students through this complex and evolving field. Educators, industry leaders, and employers who rely on an AI-skilled workforce should partner to create educational programs that equip students with essential AI skills and competencies across all learning pathways. While AI education in kindergarten through twelfth grade (K-12) is critical, our Nation must also make resources available for lifelong learners to develop new skills for a changing workforce. By establishing a strong framework that integrates early student exposure with comprehensive teacher training and other resources for workforce development, we can ensure that every American has the opportunity to learn about AI from the earliest stages of their educational journey through postsecondary education, fostering a culture of innovation and critical thinking that will solidify our Nation's leadership in the AI-driven future.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy</E>\n                    .

In Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices that Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I declared a national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, and imposed additional \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate to deal with that unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security and economy of the United States. Section 4(b) of Executive Order 14257 provided that \u00e2\u0080\u009c[s]hould any trading partner retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on U.S. exports or other measures, I may further modify the [Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States] to increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    In the Executive Order dated April 8, 2025 (Amendment to Reciprocal Tariffs and Updated Duties As Applied to Low-Value Imports from the People's Republic of China), pursuant to section 4(b) of Executive Order 14257, I ordered modification of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) to raise the applicable \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     duty rate for imports from the People's Republic of China (PRC) established in Executive Order 14257, in recognition of the fact that the PRC announced that it would retaliate against the United States in response to Executive Order 14257.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>On April 9, 2025, the State Council Tariff Commission of the PRC announced that, in response to the Executive Order dated April 8, 2025, an 84 percent tariff would be imposed on all goods imported into the PRC originating from the United States, effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 10, 2025. Pursuant to section 4(b) of Executive Order 14257, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in that order by modifying the HTSUS and taking other actions to increase the duties imposed on the PRC in response to this latest retaliation. In my judgment, this modification is necessary and appropriate to effectively address the threat to U.S. national and economic security posed by the PRC's contribution to the conditions reflected in large and persistent trade deficits, including PRC industrial policies that have produced systemic excess manufacturing capacity in the PRC and suppressed U.S. domestic manufacturing capacity, which conditions are made worse by the PRC's recent actions. </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    Section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257 provided that, \u00e2\u0080\u009c[s]hould any trading partner take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters, I may further modify the HTSUS to decrease or limit in scope the duties imposed under this order.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Since I signed Executive \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"15626\"/>\n                    Order 14257, in contrast to the PRC's actions, more than 75 other foreign trading partners, including countries enumerated in Annex I to Executive Order 14257, have approached the United States to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationships and our resulting national and economic security concerns. This is a significant step by these countries toward remedying non-reciprocal trade arrangements and aligning sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    Pursuant to section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in that order by modifying the HTSUS to temporarily suspend, for a period of 90 days, except with respect to the PRC, application of the individual \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     duties imposed for foreign trading partners listed in Annex I to Executive Order 14257, and to instead impose on articles of all such trading partners an additional \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     rate of duty as set forth herein, pursuant to the terms of, and except as otherwise provided in, Executive Order 14257, as modified by this order. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Suspension of Country-Specific Ad Valorem Rates of Duty</E>\n                    .

I declared a national emergency with respect to that threat, and to deal with that threat, I imposed certain \n                        <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                         duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate. In Annex II to Executive Order 14257, I set forth a list of certain goods that, in my judgment, should not be subject to the \n                        <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                         rates of duty imposed pursuant to that order.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>In section 4 of Executive Order 14257, section 5 of Executive Order 14326 of July 31, 2025 (Further Modifying the Reciprocal Tariff Rates), and other Executive Orders issued to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, I directed various officials to monitor the circumstances involving the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 and to recommend to me additional action that would more effectively deal with the emergency conditions described in Executive Order 14257. Based on this monitoring, among other things, I have received additional information and recommendations from these officials. After considering the information and recommendations these officials have provided to me, among other things, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to modify Annex II to Executive Order 14257 as shown in the updated version of Annex II that is attached to this order. In my judgment, these modifications are necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        Further, in section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257, I noted that I might further decrease or limit in scope the duties imposed under Executive Order 14257, as amended, if any trading partner takes significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters. Accordingly, I later temporarily suspended the individual \n                        <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                         rate of duty for certain trading partners to reflect the fact that some trading partners had signaled a willingness to undertake meaningful economic and national security commitments with the United States designed to combat the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257. In Executive Order 14326, I noted that certain foreign trading partners had agreed, or were on the verge of agreeing, to meaningful trade and security agreements with the United States, with the conclusion of the agreements to be completed in the future.\n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"43738\"/>\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>In my judgment, it is necessary and appropriate to take steps contemplated in certain current and forthcoming trade and security framework agreements (framework agreements) between a foreign trading partner and the United States. I determine that any modification of tariffs required to implement current and forthcoming framework agreements is necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), as amended; Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), as amended; Proclamation 9888 of May 17, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended; and Proclamation 10962 of July 30, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Copper Into the United States). Except in rare circumstances, I will refrain from narrowing the scope of the reciprocal tariff or any relevant section 232 tariff before the conclusion of a final trade and security agreement (final agreement) between the foreign trading partner and the United States.</FP>\n                    <FP>For example, the United States and the European Union recently announced a landmark \u00e2\u0080\u009cFramework on an Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Framework Agreement). In the joint statement announcing the Framework Agreement, the United States committed to reduce the reciprocal tariff imposed under Executive Order 14257, as amended, on certain products of the European Union to zero percent and to reduce tariffs imposed under section 232 for automobiles and automobile parts originating from the European Union if the European Union takes certain steps. In my judgment, it is necessary and appropriate to implement the tariff modifications described in the Framework Agreement. These modifications are necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 and to reduce or eliminate the threat to national security found in Proclamation 9888, as amended.</FP>\n                    <FP>Similarly, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to implement the terms of any final agreement between a foreign trading partner and the United States related to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257. In my judgment, the modifications required to implement the terms of such a final agreement are necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security I have found pursuant to section 232.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        Though I am generally unwilling for framework agreements to narrow the scope of the reciprocal tariffs or modify any relevant section 232 tariff before the conclusion of a final agreement, final agreements with the United States may include such modifications. My willingness to reduce the reciprocal tariff to zero percent for a given import or to modify tariffs imposed under section 232 will depend on numerous factors, including the scope and economic value of a trading partner's commitments to the United States in its agreement on reciprocal trade, the national interests of the United States, the need to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, and the need to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security I have found pursuant to section 232. The list of imports for which I may be willing to provide a zero percent reciprocal tariff rate is set forth in the Annex to this order entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cPotential Tariff Adjustments for Aligned Partners,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which contains products that cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States or grown, mined, or naturally produced in sufficient quantities in the United States to satisfy domestic demand; certain agricultural products; aircraft and aircraft parts; and non-patented articles for use in pharmaceutical applications. Given the complex, fact-specific, and sensitive nature of negotiations and the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, among other relevant considerations, the imports that might receive a reciprocal tariff rate of zero percent may be different for each final agreement between a foreign trading partner and the United States.\n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"43739\"/>\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                        . \n                        <E T=\"03\">Updating Scope of Duties Globally.</E>\n                         (a) The updated version of Annex II to Executive Order 14257 is attached to this order and shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 3 days after the date of this order.\n                    </FP>\n                    <P>(b) The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) shall be modified as provided in Annex I to this order.

Cities and small towns alike, from Charleroi, Pennsylvania, and Springfield, Ohio, to Whitewater, Wisconsin, have seen significant influxes of migrants. Even major urban centers such as New York City, Chicago, and Denver have sought Federal aid to manage the burden of new arrivals. Some jurisdictions, like New York and Massachusetts, have even recently declared states of emergency because of increased migration.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>The United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees. This order suspends the USRAP until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy.</E>\n                     It is the policy of the United States to ensure that public safety and national security are paramount considerations in the administration of the USRAP, and to admit only those refugees who can fully and appropriately assimilate into the United States and to ensure that the United States preserves taxpayer resources for its citizens. It is also the policy of the United States that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 3</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.</E>\n                     (a) I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that entry into the United States of refugees under the USRAP would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. I therefore direct that entry into the United States of refugees under the USRAP be suspended\u00e2\u0080\u0094subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (c) of this section\u00e2\u0080\u0094until a finding is made in accordance with section 4 of this order.

In that order, I found that those conditions constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        To deal with the emergency declared in Executive Order 14193, I imposed an additional \n                        <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                         rate of duty of 25 percent on certain articles that are products of Canada and an additional \n                        <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                         rate of duty of 10 percent on certain energy or energy resources that are products of Canada. In Executive Order 14231 of March 6, 2025 (Amendment to Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), I provided that the additional \n                        <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                         rates of duties under Executive Order 14193 do not apply to articles that are products of Canada that qualify for duty-free entry under the Agreement between the United States of America, United Mexican States, and Canada (USMCA), and I reduced the additional \n                        <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                         rate of duty on potash from 25 percent to 10 percent.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>Section 2(d) of Executive Order 14193 provides that \u00e2\u0080\u009c[s]hould Canada retaliate against the United States . . . through import duties on United States exports to Canada or similar measures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay increase or expand in scope the duties imposed . . . to ensure the efficacy of th[e] action\u00e2\u0080\u009d taken in Executive Order 14193.

My Administration is committed to addressing the significant risks associated with law firms, particularly so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cBig Law\u00e2\u0080\u009d firms, that engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests. Many firms take actions that threaten public safety and national security, limit constitutional freedoms, degrade the quality of American elections, or undermine bedrock American principles. Moreover, law firms regularly conduct this harmful activity through their powerful pro bono practices, earmarking hundreds of millions of their clients' dollars for destructive causes, that often directly or indirectly harm their own clients. Lawyers and law firms that engage in such egregious conduct should not have access to our Nation's secrets, nor should such conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Jenner &amp; Block LLP (Jenner) is yet another law firm that has abandoned the profession's highest ideals, condoned partisan \u00e2\u0080\u009clawfare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and abused its pro bono practice to engage in activities that undermine justice and the interests of the United States. For example, Jenner engages in obvious partisan representations to achieve political ends, supports attacks against women and children based on a refusal to accept the biological reality of sex, and backs the obstruction of efforts to prevent illegal aliens from committing horrific crimes and trafficking deadly drugs within our borders. Moreover, Jenner discriminates against its employees based on race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws, including through the use of race-based \u00e2\u0080\u009ctargets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</FP>\n                <FP>In addition, Jenner was \u00e2\u0080\u009cthrilled\u00e2\u0080\u009d to re-hire the unethical Andrew Weissmann after his time engaging in partisan prosecution as part of Robert Mueller's entirely unjustified investigation. Andrew Weissmann's career has been rooted in weaponized government and abuse of power, including devastating tens of thousands of American families who worked for the now defunct Arthur Andersen LLP, only to have his unlawfully aggressive prosecution overturned by the Supreme Court. The numerous reports of Weissmann's dishonesty, including pursuit of nonexistent crimes, bribery to foreign nationals, and overt demand that the Federal Government pursue a political agenda against me, is a concerning indictment of Jenner's values and priorities. </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Security Clearance Review</E>\n                    .

More than simply providing entertainment, many American content creators rely on the TikTok application for their livelihood and many American businesses rely on it for their advertising.</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(ii) The Congress passed the Act in response to concerns from the United States national security community that the TikTok application is under the control of a foreign adversary.</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(iii) The divestiture proposed in the Framework Agreement resolves these national security concerns and complies with the Act because it removes the TikTok application and certain other applications from the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontrol\u00e2\u0080\u009d of a foreign adversary and precludes any \u00e2\u0080\u009coperational relationship\u00e2\u0080\u009d between a formerly affiliated entity controlled by a foreign adversary and the new joint venture.</FP>\n                <P SOURCE=\"P1\">(A) First, the divestiture removes the TikTok application and certain other applications from the control of a foreign adversary, as defined under the Act, because, among other things, the new joint venture would be based in the United States and less than 20 percent of the joint venture would be owned or controlled by foreign adversary entities or persons.</P>\n                <P SOURCE=\"P1\">(B) Second, the divestiture puts the operation of the algorithms and code, as well as content-moderation decisions, under the control of the new joint venture.</P>\n                <P SOURCE=\"P1\">(C) Third, the divestiture prohibits the storage of sensitive United States user data in a manner that would place such data under the control of a foreign adversary and requires such data be stored in a cloud environment run by an American company.</P>\n                <P SOURCE=\"P1\">(D) Fourth, the divestiture includes intense monitoring of software updates, algorithms, and data flows by the United States' trusted security partners, and it requires all recommendation models, including algorithms, that use United States user data to be retrained and monitored by those trusted security partners.</P>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(iv) These safeguards would protect the American people from the misuse of their data and the influence of a foreign adversary, while also allowing the millions of American viewers, creators, and businesses that rely on the TikTok application to continue using it.</FP>\n                <P>\n                    (c) Based on these findings, I further determine that the divestiture of the applications outlined in the Framework Agreement, once its implementation agreements are executed, is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cqualified divestiture\u00e2\u0080\u009d under the Act, including with respect to the TikTok applications, the Lemon8 application, the CapCut applications, any other application or website duly operated by the new joint venture, and their associated or affiliated websites.\n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"47221\"/>\n                </P>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 3</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Action.</E>\n                     (a) To permit the contemplated divestiture to be completed, the Attorney General shall not take any action on behalf of the United States to enforce the Act for 120 days from the date of this order. During this period, the Department of Justice shall take no action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any noncompliance with the Act, including for distributing, maintaining, or updating (or enabling the distribution, maintenance, or updating of) any foreign adversary controlled application as defined in the Act. In light of this direction, even after the expiration of the above-specified period, the Department of Justice shall not take any action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period or any period prior to the issuance of this order, including the period of time from January 19, 2025, to the issuance of this order.\n                </FP>\n                <P>(b) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to issue written guidance to implement the provisions of subsection (a) of this section.</P>\n                <P>(c) The Attorney General shall issue a letter to appropriate providers stating that there has been no violation of the Act and that there is no liability for any conduct that occurs during the 120-day period specified in subsection (a) of this section, as well as for any conduct from the effective date of the Act until the issuance of this order.</P>\n                <P>(d) Because of the national security interests at stake and because section 2(d) of the Act vests the sole authority for investigations and enforcement of the Act in the Attorney General, attempted enforcement by the States or private parties represents an encroachment on the powers of the Executive. The Attorney General shall exercise all available authority to preserve and defend the Executive's exclusive authority to enforce the Act, including the President's determination of a qualified divestiture.</P>\n                <P>(e) The Attorney General or the Attorney General's designee shall serve as the United States Government's representative under the Framework Agreement. The Attorney General shall receive any information from the new joint venture, trusted security partners, or any other party from whom information is provided pursuant to the Framework Agreement and this order on behalf of the United States Government. Trusted security partners may also share information with other United States Government officials.</P>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 4</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Amendment and Revocation.</E>\n                     The Presidential Memorandum of July 24, 2024 (Delegation of Authority Under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act), is hereby revoked. As described in this order, I have determined that the divestiture outlined in the Framework Agreement constitutes a \u00e2\u0080\u009cqualified divestiture\u00e2\u0080\u009d under the Act and resolves the national security concerns the Act addresses.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>I further determine that:</FP>\n                <P>(a) The Order of August 14, 2020 (Regarding the Acquisition of Musical.ly by ByteDance Ltd.)

The United States led the development of civilian nuclear power through the Atomic Energy Commission, the National Reactor Testing Station (now known as Idaho National Laboratory), and several other Federal Government entities. This work produced safe and abundant energy. But in the decades since, commercial deployment of new nuclear technologies has all but stopped. The Idaho National Laboratory has principal responsibility for constructing and testing new reactor designs; it concluded construction of new reactors in the 1970s. Our proud history of innovation has succumbed to overregulated complacency.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>As I stated in Executive Order 14156 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Energy Emergency), the United States needs a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive development of advanced technologies, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain modern life and national security. Nuclear energy both is vital to this effort and has never held so much promise. Decades of research and engineering have produced prototypes of advanced nuclear technologies that incorporate passive safety mechanisms, improve the physical architecture of reactor designs, increase reactor operational flexibility and performance, and reduce risk in fuel disposal. Advanced reactors\u00e2\u0080\u0094including microreactors, small modular reactors, and Generation IV and Generation III+ reactors\u00e2\u0080\u0094have revolutionary potential. They will open a range of new applications to support data centers, microchip manufacturing, petrochemical production, healthcare, desalination, hydrogen production, and other industries.</FP>\n                <FP>The United States cultivated the effort to design and build the first Generation IV reactor for commercial use, but the Federal Government has effectively throttled the domestic deployment of advanced reactors, ceding the initiative to foreign nations in building this critical technology. That changes today. It is the policy of my Administration to foster nuclear innovation and bring advanced nuclear technologies into domestic production as soon as possible.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Definitions</E>\n                    .

Such an environment operates as an echo chamber, in which students are forced to accept these ideologies without question or critical examination. In many cases, innocent children are compelled to adopt identities as either victims or oppressors solely based on their skin color and other immutable characteristics. In other instances, young men and women are made to question whether they were born in the wrong body and whether to view their parents and their reality as enemies to be blamed. These practices not only erode critical thinking but also sow division, confusion, and distrust, which undermine the very foundations of personal identity and family unity.</FP>\n                <FP>Imprinting anti-American, subversive, harmful, and false ideologies on our Nation's children not only violates longstanding anti-discrimination civil rights law in many cases, but usurps basic parental authority. For example, steering students toward surgical and chemical mutilation without parental consent or involvement or allowing males access to private spaces designated for females may contravene Federal laws that protect parental rights, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA), and sex-based equality and opportunity, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX).

My first term included numerous significant actions, including some of the most aggressive in recent history, to deliver lower prescription drug prices to American patients. The message was clear: no longer would the executive branch sit idly by as pharmaceutical manufacturers charged patients in our Nation more than those in other countries for the exact same prescription drugs, often made in the exact same places.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>These actions included encouraging the development of generic and biosimilar alternatives to higher cost brand name prescription drugs and biologics to harness competitive forces and increase access to affordable medicines. The United States also, for the first time, established a pathway to expand access to lower cost drugs imported from outside of the country. Reform efforts ensured that Government-mandated discounts were passed through to patients instead of being retained by middlemen. New price transparency rules were promulgated to allow patients, doctors, and employers to see the actual cost of prescription drugs before purchase. Insulin copayments were capped for Medicare beneficiaries, and manufacturers, instead of patients and taxpayers, were forced to foot the bill through the provision of larger discounts. I also called on the Congress to come to the table to help craft sustainable solutions that would promote innovation and affordable access for the long-term. When the Congress refused, I proposed the test of an innovative new payment mechanism that would prevent drug manufacturers from charging our patients much higher prices than those found abroad.</FP>\n                <FP>Combined, these bold actions were delivering real savings for American patients and set the foundation to dramatically narrow the price disparity between the United States and foreign nations over time.</FP>\n                <FP>Unsurprisingly, the Biden Administration reversed, walked back, or neglected many of these initiatives, undoing the progress made for American patients. The Biden Administration then signed into law the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, which included the Medicare Prescription Drug Negotiation Program. While this program has the commendable goal of reducing the drug prices Medicare and its beneficiaries pay, its administratively complex and expensive regime has thus far produced much lower savings than projected. Further, accompanying changes to the Medicare Part D program led to inflated premiums and diminished coverage choices for seniors, prompting a taxpayer-funded bailout of insurance companies offering Part D plans. Finally, the program imposes price controls on small molecule prescription drugs, usually in tablet or capsule form, 4 years earlier than on large molecule biological products. Known as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpill penalty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d this discrepancy threatens to distort innovation by pushing investment towards expensive biological products, which are often indicated to treat rarer diseases, and away from small molecule prescription drugs, which are generally cheaper and treat larger patient populations.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    The American people deserve better. It is time to restore the progress our Nation made in my first term to deliver lower prescription drug prices by putting Americans first and making America healthy again. \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"16442\"/>\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy</E>\n                    .

This egregious imbalance is orchestrated through a purposeful scheme in which drug manufacturers deeply discount their products to access foreign markets, and subsidize that decrease through enormously high prices in the United States.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>The United States has for too long turned its back on Americans, who unwittingly sponsor both drug manufacturers and other countries. These entities today rely on price markups on American consumers, generous public subsidies for research and development primarily through the National Institutes of Health, and robust public financing of prescription drug consumption through Federal and State healthcare programs. Drug manufacturers, rather than seeking to equalize evident price discrimination, agree to other countries' demands for low prices, and simultaneously fight against the ability for public and private payers in the United States to negotiate the best prices for patients.

The Constitution vests all executive power in the President and charges him with faithfully executing the laws. Since it would be impossible for the President to single-handedly perform all the executive business of the Federal Government, the Constitution also provides for subordinate officers to assist the President in his executive duties. In the exercise of their often-considerable authority, these executive branch officials remain subject to the President's ongoing supervision and control. The President in turn is regularly elected by and accountable to the American people. This is one of the structural safeguards, along with the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, regular elections for the Congress, and an independent judiciary whose judges are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, by which the Framers created a Government accountable to the American people.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>However, previous administrations have allowed so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cindependent regulatory agencies\u00e2\u0080\u009d to operate with minimal Presidential supervision. These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people. Moreover, these regulatory agencies have been permitted to promulgate significant regulations without review by the President.</FP>\n                <FP>These practices undermine such regulatory agencies' accountability to the American people and prevent a unified and coherent execution of Federal law. For the Federal Government to be truly accountable to the American people, officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people's elected President.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    Therefore, in order to improve the administration of the executive branch and to increase regulatory officials' accountability to the American people, it shall be the policy of the executive branch to ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch. Moreover, all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Executive Office of the President before publication in the \n                    <E T=\"03\">Federal Register</E>\n                    . \n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Definitions</E>\n                    .

They wanted America's public buildings to inspire the American people and encourage civic virtue. President George Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson consciously modeled the most important buildings in Washington, DC, on the classical architecture of ancient Athens and Rome. They sought to use classical architecture to visually connect our contemporary Republic with the antecedents of democracy in classical antiquity, reminding citizens not only of their rights but also their responsibilities in maintaining and perpetuating its institutions.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Washington and Jefferson personally oversaw the competitions to design the Capitol Building and the White House. Under the direction and following the vision of these two Founders, Pierre Charles L'Enfant designed the Nation's capital as a classical city. For approximately a century and a half following America's founding, America's Federal architecture continued to be characterized by beautiful and beloved buildings of largely, though not exclusively, classical design. In the 1960s, the Federal Government largely replaced traditional designs for new construction with modernist and brutalist ones. The Federal architecture that ensued, overseen by the General Services Administration (GSA), was often unpopular with Americans. The new buildings ranged from the undistinguished to designs even GSA now admits many in the public found unappealing.</FP>\n                <FP>In 1994, GSA responded to this widespread criticism by establishing the Design Excellence Program. The GSA intended that program to \u00e2\u0080\u009cprovide visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American Government.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Unfortunately, the program has not met this goal. Under the Design Excellence Program, GSA has often selected designs by prominent architects with little regard for local input or regional aesthetic preferences. The resulting Federal architecture sometimes impresses the architectural elite, but not the American people who the buildings are meant to serve. Many of these new Federal buildings are not even visibly identifiable as civic buildings.</FP>\n                <FP>It is time to update the policies guiding Federal architecture to address these problems and ensure that architects designing Federal buildings serve their clients, the American people.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy.</E>\n                     (a) Applicable Federal public buildings should uplift and beautify public spaces, inspire the human spirit, ennoble the United States, and command respect from the general public.

Because of their proven ability to meet these requirements, classical and traditional architecture are preferred modes of architectural design. This preference does not exclude the possibility of alternative styles in appropriate circumstances. Major emphasis should be placed on the choice of designs that embody architectural excellence. Specific attention should be paid to the possibilities of incorporating into such designs qualities that reflect the regional architectural traditions of that part of the Nation in which buildings are located. Where appropriate, fine art should be incorporated in the designs, with emphasis on the work of living American artists. Designs shall adhere to sound construction practice and utilize materials, methods, and equipment of proven dependability. Buildings shall be economical to build, operate, and maintain, and should be accessible to the handicapped.\n                </FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(ii) Design must flow from the needs of the Government and the aspirations and preferences of the American people to the architectural profession, and not vice versa.

Coal is abundant and cost effective, and can be used in any weather condition. Moreover, the industry has historically employed hundreds of thousands of Americans. America's coal resources are vast, with a current estimated value in the trillions of dollars, and are more than capable of substantially contributing to American energy independence with excess to export to support allies and our economic competitiveness. Our Nation's beautiful clean coal resources will be critical to meeting the rise in electricity demand due to the resurgence of domestic manufacturing and the construction of artificial intelligence data processing centers. We must encourage and support our Nation's coal industry to increase our energy supply, lower electricity costs, stabilize our grid, create high-paying jobs, support burgeoning industries, and assist our allies.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy.</E>\n                     It is the policy of the United States that coal is essential to our national and economic security.

Longstanding Department of Defense (DoD) policy (DoD Instruction (DoDI) 6130.03) provides that it is the policy of the DoD to ensure that service members are \u00e2\u0080\u009c[f]ree of medical conditions or physical defects that may reasonably be expected to require excessive time lost from duty for necessary treatment or hospitalization.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As a result, many mental and physical health conditions are incompatible with active duty, from conditions that require substantial medication or medical treatment to bipolar and related disorders, eating disorders, suicidality, and prior psychiatric hospitalization.</FP>\n                <FP>Consistent with the military mission and longstanding DoD policy, expressing a false \u00e2\u0080\u009cgender identity\u00e2\u0080\u009d divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service. Beyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved, adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life. A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.</FP>\n                <FP>For the sake of our Nation and the patriotic Americans who volunteer to serve it, military service must be reserved for those mentally and physically fit for duty.

These DTOs collaborate and conspire with transnational cartels and other global partners to smuggle drugs into the United States, utilizing clandestine airstrips, maritime routes, tunnels, and overland corridors, and both willing and unwilling human couriers.</FP>\n                <FP>The Mexican DTOs have an intolerable alliance with the government of Mexico. This alliance endangers the national security of the United States, and we must eradicate the influence of these dangerous cartels from the bilateral environment. The government of Mexico has afforded safe havens for the cartels to engage in the manufacturing and transportation of illicit drugs, which collectively have led to the overdose deaths of hundreds of thousands of American victims.</FP>\n                <FP>Mexican cartels are also implicated in human trafficking and smuggling operations, enabling the illegal migration of millions across our borders. These operations are often tied to organized crime, and they create pathways for cartel activities to expand into the United States. Furthermore, violent criminals originating from Central and South America easily transit into and through Mexico, and into the United States, where they cause irreparable harm to our citizens. These dangerous criminals are involved in drug-related violence, gang activity, and other crimes that endanger the safety of American communities.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    Immediate action is required to address the national emergency I declared in Proclamation 10886 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border of the United States), and to finally end the public \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"9118\"/>\n                    health crisis caused by opioid use and addiction, which will not happen unless the compliance and cooperation of the government of Mexico is assured.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>I hereby determine and order:</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Section 1</E>\n                    . (a) As President of the United States, my highest duty is the defense of the country and its citizens. A Nation without borders is not a Nation at all. I will not stand by and allow our sovereignty to be eroded, our laws to be trampled, our citizens to be endangered, or our borders to be disrespected anymore.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>I previously declared a national emergency with respect to the grave threat to the United States posed by the influx of illegal aliens and illicit drugs into the United States in Proclamation 10886. Pursuant to the NEA, I hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in that proclamation to cover the failure of Mexico to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept DTOs, other drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs. In addition, this failure to act on the part of the government of Mexico constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. I hereby declare and reiterate a national emergency under the NEA and IEEPA to deal with that threat. This national emergency requires decisive and immediate action, and I have decided to impose, consistent with law, ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of Mexico as set forth in this order. In doing so, I invoke my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA, and specifically find that action under other authority to impose tariffs is inadequate to address this unusual and extraordinary threat.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    .

The District of Columbia government's pretrial release policies, which include prohibiting cash bail, contribute to the disgraceful conditions referenced in the aforementioned Executive Order, as law enforcement must arrest the same individuals multiple times, and dangerous criminals are sometimes rapidly released. This leaves such criminals free to endanger American citizens visiting our Nation's capital, Federal workers discharging their duties to our Nation, and citizens of the District of Columbia trying to live their lives safely.

I declared a national emergency with respect to that threat, and to deal with that threat, I imposed certain \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    In Executive Order 14259 of April 8, 2025 (Amendment to Reciprocal Tariffs and Updated Duties as Applied to Low-Value Imports From the People's Republic of China), and Executive Order 14266 of April 9, 2025 (Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates to Reflect Trading Partner Retaliation and Alignment), I ordered modifications of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) to raise the applicable \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     duty rate for imports from the People's Republic of China (PRC) established in Executive Order 14257, in recognition of the fact that the State Council Tariff Commission of the PRC announced that it would retaliate against the United States in response to Executive Order 14257 and Executive Order 14259.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    Subsequently, the United States entered into discussions with the PRC to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationship and our resulting national and economic security concerns. Therefore, in Executive Order 14298 of May 12, 2025 (Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates to Reflect Discussions With the People's Republic of China), I determined that it was necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 by modifying the HTSUS to suspend for a period of 90 days application of the additional \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     duties imposed on the PRC listed in Annex I to Executive Order 14257, as amended, and to instead impose on articles of the PRC an additional \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     rate of duty as set forth in Executive Order 14298, pursuant to the terms of, and except as otherwise provided in, Executive Order 14257, as amended.

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of the regime of Nicol\u00c3\u00a1s Maduro in Venezuela continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.  The activities of the Tren de Aragua gang, a transnational criminal organization originating in Venezuela and designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist organization, have intensified this threat, as highlighted in Proclamation 10903 of March 14, 2025 (Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua).

The prior administration's open-borders policies facilitated the infiltration of the United States by members of Tren de Aragua, allowing these dangerous criminals to establish a foothold within United States cities and prey upon American citizens. The Maduro regime aided and facilitated the influx of Tren de Aragua members into the United States during the prior administration by failing to control its borders, permitting the gang's operations to flourish within Venezuela, and refusing to take action against its members, thereby exacerbating the illegal immigration crisis.\n                </FP>\n                <P>\n                    (b) Existing sanctions on Venezuela, including those imposed in Executive Order 13692, Executive Order 13808 of August 24, 2017 (Imposing Additional Sanctions with Respect to the Situation in Venezuela), Executive Order 13850 of November 1, 2018 (Blocking Property of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation in Venezuela), and Executive Order 13884 of August 5, 2019 (Blocking Property of the Government of Venezuela), remain in effect.

It is the policy of the United States to recognize that circumstances that gave rise to the actions taken in the Executive Orders described in section 3(a) of this order, related to the policies and actions of the former regime of Bashar al-Assad, have been transformed by developments over the past 6 months, including the positive actions taken by the new Syrian government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa.  This order supports United States national security and foreign policy goals by directing additional actions, including the removal of sanctions on Syria, the issuance of waivers that permit the relaxation of export controls and other restrictions on Syria, and other actions to be taken by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Commerce, as well as by other executive departments and agencies (agencies) of the United States, without providing relief to ISIS or other terrorist organizations, human rights abusers, those linked to chemical weapons or proliferation-related activities, or other persons that threaten the peace, security, or stability of the United States, Syria, and its neighbors. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 3</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Revocation of Syria Sanctions</E>\n                    .

Many have engaged in activities that make our communities less safe, increase burdens on local businesses, limit constitutional freedoms, and degrade the quality of American elections. Additionally, they have sometimes done so on behalf of clients, pro bono, or ostensibly \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the public good\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094potentially depriving those who cannot otherwise afford the benefit of top legal talent the access to justice deserved by all.

In 2021, a Paul Weiss partner and former leading prosecutor in the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller brought a pro bono suit against individuals alleged to have participated in the events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, on behalf of the District of Columbia Attorney General.</FP>\n                <FP>In 2022, Paul Weiss hired unethical attorney Mark Pomerantz, who had previously left Paul Weiss to join the Manhattan District Attorney's office solely to manufacture a prosecution against me and who, according to his co-workers, unethically led witnesses in ways designed to implicate me. After being unable to convince even Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg that a fraud case was feasible, Pomerantz engaged in a media campaign to gin up support for this unwarranted prosecution.</FP>\n                <FP>Additionally, Paul Weiss discriminates against its own employees on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws. Paul Weiss, along with nearly every other large, influential, or industry leading law firm, makes decisions around \u00e2\u0080\u009ctargets\u00e2\u0080\u009d based on race and sex.

The General Terms outline a historic trade deal that provides American companies unprecedented access to British markets while bolstering the national security and economy of the United States. The deal includes billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports, especially for beef, ethanol, and certain other American agricultural exports. In addition, the United Kingdom will reduce or eliminate numerous non-tariff barriers that unfairly discriminate against American products, hurt the United States' manufacturing base, and threaten the national security of the United States.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>The General Terms provide, among other things, that the United States intends to create an annual quota of 100,000 vehicles for United Kingdom automotive imports at a 10 percent tariff rate. In the General Terms, the United Kingdom also committed to working to meet American requirements on the security of the supply chains of steel and aluminum products intended for export to the United States and on the nature of ownership of relevant production facilities. Provided the United Kingdom meets these requirements, the United States intends to promptly construct a quota at most-favored-nation rates for steel and aluminum articles and certain derivative steel and aluminum articles that are products of the United Kingdom in the context of implementing the General Terms.</FP>\n                <FP>Furthermore, in the General Terms, the United States and the United Kingdom committed to negotiate significantly preferential treatment outcomes on pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients that are products of the United Kingdom, contingent on the findings of an investigation regarding pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients under section 232, and provided that the United Kingdom complies with certain supply chain security standards. Finally, in the General Terms, the United States and the United Kingdom committed to adopt a structured, negotiated approach to addressing United States national security concerns regarding sectors that may be subject to future section 232 investigations. To that end, the United States and the United Kingdom further committed to strengthen aerospace and aircraft manufacturing supply chains by establishing tariff-free bilateral trade in certain aerospace products.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    In my judgment, I determine that the following actions are consistent with the national interests of the United States and are necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"26420\"/>\n                    Goods Trade Deficits), as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), as amended; Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), as amended; and Proclamation 9888 of May 17, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Automobiles and Automobile Parts.</E>\n                     (a) I hereby establish an annual tariff-rate quota of 100,000 automobiles as classified in heading 8703 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) and as further specified in note 33(b) to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS for automobiles that are products of the United Kingdom.

American life expectancy significantly lags behind other developed countries, with pre-COVID-19 United States life expectancy averaging 78.8 years and comparable countries averaging 82.6 years. This equates to 1.25 billion fewer life years for the United States population. Six in 10 Americans have at least one chronic disease, and four in 10 have two or more chronic diseases. An estimated one in five United States adults lives with a mental illness.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>These realities become even more painful when contrasted with nations around the globe. Across 204 countries and territories, the United States had the highest age-standardized incidence rate of cancer in 2021, nearly double the next-highest rate. Further, from 1990-2021, the United States experienced an 88 percent increase in cancer, the largest percentage increase of any country evaluated. In 2021, asthma was more than twice as common in the United States than most of Europe, Asia, or Africa. Autism spectrum disorders had the highest prevalence in high-income countries, including the United States, in 2021. Similarly, autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis are more commonly diagnosed in high-income areas such as Europe and North America. Overall, the global comparison data demonstrates that the health of Americans is on an alarming trajectory that requires immediate action.</FP>\n                <FP>This concern applies urgently to America's children. In 2022, an estimated 30 million children (40.7 percent) had at least one health condition, such as allergies, asthma, or an autoimmune disease. Autism spectrum disorder now affects 1 in 36 children in the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0094a staggering increase from rates of 1 to 4 out of 10,000 children identified with the condition during the 1980s. Eighteen percent of late adolescents and young adults have fatty liver disease, close to 30 percent of adolescents are prediabetic, and more than 40 percent of adolescents are overweight or obese.</FP>\n                <FP>These health burdens have continued to increase alongside the increased prescription of medication. For example, in the case of Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, over 3.4 million children are now on medication for the disorder\u00e2\u0080\u0094up from 3.2 million children in 2019-2020\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the number of children being diagnosed with the condition continues to rise. </FP>\n                <FP>This poses a dire threat to the American people and our way of life. Seventy-seven percent of young adults do not qualify for the military based in large part on their health scores. Ninety percent of the Nation's $4.5 trillion in annual healthcare expenditures is for people with chronic and mental health conditions. In short, Americans of all ages are becoming sicker, beset by illnesses that our medical system is not addressing effectively. These trends harm us, our economy, and our security.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    To fully address the growing health crisis in America, we must re-direct our national focus, in the public and private sectors, toward understanding and drastically lowering chronic disease rates and ending childhood chronic disease. This includes fresh thinking on nutrition, physical activity, healthy \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"9834\"/>\n                    lifestyles, over-reliance on medication and treatments, the effects of new technological habits, environmental impacts, and food and drug quality and safety. We must restore the integrity of the scientific process by protecting expert recommendations from inappropriate influence and increasing transparency regarding existing data. We must ensure our healthcare system promotes health rather than just managing disease.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy</E>\n                    . It shall be the policy of the Federal Government to aggressively combat the critical health challenges facing our citizens, including the rising rates of mental health disorders, obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases.

The Agreement establishes a tariff framework that levels the playing field for American producers and accounts for American national security needs. In my judgment, the Agreement is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), as amended; Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), as amended; Proclamation 9888 of May 17, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended; and Proclamation 10962 of July 30, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Copper Into the United States). The Agreement will reduce the United States trade deficit, boost the economy of the United States, and address the consequences of the United States trade deficit, including by strengthening the manufacturing and defense industrial base of the United States.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>Under the Agreement, the United States will apply a baseline 15 percent tariff on nearly all Japanese imports entering the United States, alongside separate sector-specific treatment for automobiles and automobile parts; aerospace products; generic pharmaceuticals; and natural resources that are not naturally available or produced in the United States. This new tariff framework, combined with expanded United States exports and investment-driven production, will help reduce the trade deficit with Japan and restore greater balance to the overall United States trade position.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        Japan, meanwhile, will provide American manufacturing, aerospace, agriculture, food, energy, automobile, and industrial goods producers with breakthrough openings in market access across key sectors. Specifically, the Government of Japan is working toward an expedited implementation of a 75 percent increase of United States rice procurements within the Minimum Access rice scheme and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel), as well as other United States products, in amounts totaling $8 billion per year. The Government of Japan is also working to accept for sale in Japan United States-manufactured and United States-safety-certified passenger vehicles without additional testing. Separately, Japan will purchase United States-made commercial aircraft, as well as United States defense equipment.\n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"43536\"/>\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>Critically, unlike any other agreement in American history, the Government of Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States. These investments\u00e2\u0080\u0094which will be selected by the United States Government\u00e2\u0080\u0094will generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.</FP>\n                    <FP>In my judgment, I determine that the following actions are consistent with the national interest of the United States and are necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704, as amended; Proclamation 9705, as amended; Proclamation 9888, as amended; and Proclamation 10962.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                        . \n                        <E T=\"03\">General Tariffs.</E>\n                         (a) The additional \n                        <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                         rate of duty applicable to products of Japan shall be determined by a product's current \n                        <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                         (or \n                        <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                         equivalent) rate of duty under column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (\u00e2\u0080\u009cColumn 1 Duty Rate\u00e2\u0080\u009d).

Our Nation's security, prosperity, and freedom would not be possible without our veterans. Many service members paid the ultimate sacrifice.

During the previous administration, unaccountable bureaucrats treated them shamefully, failing veterans when they needed help most and betraying the taxpayers who rightfully expect better.</FP>\n                <FP>The story of the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center is indicative of this failure. More than one hundred years ago, Senator John Percival Jones and Arcadia Bandini de Stearns Baker generously donated hundreds of acres of land that they owned in West Los Angeles on the condition that it be used to house disabled veterans. The campus once featured a chapel, billiard hall, 1,000-seat theater, and housed about 6,000 veterans, but the Federal Government has since allowed this crown jewel of veteran care to deteriorate over the last few decades. </FP>\n                <FP>The Department of Veterans Affairs (Department) leased parts of the property to a private school, private companies, and the baseball team of the University of California, Los Angeles, sometimes at significantly below-market prices. As of 2024, there were approximately 3,000 homeless veterans in Los Angeles, more than in any other city in the country and accounting for about 10 percent of all of America's homeless veterans. Many of these heroes live in squalor in Los Angeles's infamous \u00e2\u0080\u009cskid row.\u00e2\u0080\u009d </FP>\n                <FP>During my first term, I signed legislation to increase accountability and expand benefits and choices for veterans in accessing care, and my second term will build on those efforts. Accountability will return to the Department. Veterans around the Nation will have more choices in care, benefits, and services. The VA campus in West Los Angeles will become the National Center for Warrior Independence with facilities and resources to help our veterans earn back their self-sufficiency. </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Establishing the National Center for Warrior Independence</E>\n                    .

Before, during, and after the founding of the United States, our cities, States, and country have continuously relied upon capital punishment as the ultimate deterrent and only proper punishment for the vilest crimes. Our Founders knew well that only capital punishment can bring justice and restore order in response to such evil. For this and other reasons, capital punishment continues to enjoy broad popular support.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Yet for too long, politicians and judges who oppose capital punishment have defied and subverted the laws of our country. At every turn, they seek to thwart the execution of lawfully imposed capital sentences and choose to enforce their personal beliefs rather than the law. When President Biden took office in 2021, he allowed his Department of Justice to issue a moratorium on Federal executions, in defiance of his duty to faithfully execute the laws of the United States that provide for capital punishment. And on December 23, 2024, President Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 most vile and sadistic rapists, child molesters, and murderers on Federal death row: remorseless criminals who brutalized young children, strangled and drowned their victims, and hunted strangers for sport. He commuted their sentences even though the laws of our Nation have always protected victims by applying capital punishment to barbaric acts like theirs. Judges who oppose capital punishment have likewise disregarded the law by falsely claiming that capital punishment is unconstitutional, even though the Constitution explicitly acknowledges the legality of capital punishment.</FP>\n                <FP>These efforts to subvert and undermine capital punishment defy the laws of our nation, make a mockery of justice, and insult the victims of these horrible crimes. The Government's most solemn responsibility is to protect its citizens from abhorrent acts, and my Administration will not tolerate efforts to stymie and eviscerate the laws that authorize capital punishment against those who commit horrible acts of violence against American citizens.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy.</E>\n                     It is the policy of the United States to ensure that the laws that authorize capital punishment are respected and faithfully implemented, and to counteract the politicians and judges who subvert the law by obstructing and preventing the execution of capital sentences.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 3</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Federal Capital Punishment.</E>\n                     (a) The Attorney General shall pursue the death penalty for all crimes of a severity demanding its use.\n                </FP>\n                <P>(b) In addition to pursuing the death penalty where possible, the Attorney General shall, where consistent with applicable law, pursue Federal jurisdiction and seek the death penalty regardless of other factors for every federal capital crime involving:</P>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(i) The murder of a law-enforcement officer; or</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(ii) A capital crime committed by an alien illegally present in this country.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    The Attorney General shall encourage State attorneys general and district attorneys to bring State capital charges for all capital crimes with special \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"8464\"/>\n                    attention to the crimes described in Subsections (i) and (ii), regardless of whether the federal trial results in a capital sentence.\n                </FP>\n                <P>(d) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to modify the Justice Manual based on the policy and purpose set forth in this Executive Order.</P>\n                <P>(e) The Attorney General shall evaluate the places of imprisonment and conditions of confinement for each of the 37 murderers whose Federal death sentences were commuted by President Biden, and the Attorney General shall take all lawful and appropriate action to ensure that these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose.

The Founders envisioned a Nation in which religious voices and views are integral to a vibrant public square and human flourishing and in which religious people and institutions are free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or hostility from the Government. Indeed, the roots of religious liberty stretch back to the early settlers who fled religious persecution in Europe, seeking a new world where they could choose, follow, and practice their faith without interference from the Government. The principle of religious liberty was enshrined in American law with the First Amendment to the Constitution in 1791. Since that time, the Constitution has protected the fundamental right to religious liberty as Americans' first freedom.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>During my first term, I issued Executive Order 13798 of May 4, 2017 (Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty). Pursuant to that order, the Attorney General issued a memorandum for all executive departments and agencies (agencies) titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cFederal Law Protections for Religious Liberty\u00e2\u0080\u009d on October 6, 2017. The Supreme Court has also continued to vindicate the Founders' commitment to religious liberty, including by giving effect to the principle that religious voices should be welcomed on an equal basis in the public square.</FP>\n                <FP>In recent years, some Federal, State, and local policies have threatened America's unique and beautiful tradition of religious liberty. These policies attempt to infringe upon longstanding conscience protections, prevent parents from sending their children to religious schools, threaten loss of funding or denial of non-profit tax status for faith-based entities, and single out religious groups and institutions for exclusion from governmental programs. Some opponents of religious liberty would remove religion entirely from public life. Others characterize religious liberty as inconsistent with civil rights, despite religions' vital roles in the abolition of slavery; the passage of Federal civil rights laws; and the provision of indispensable social, educational, and health services.</FP>\n                <FP>President Ronald Reagan reminded us that \u00e2\u0080\u009cfreedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Americans need to be reacquainted with our Nation's superb experiment in religious freedom in order to preserve it against emerging threats. Therefore, the Federal Government will promote citizens' pride in our foundational history, identify emerging threats to religious liberty, uphold Federal laws that protect all citizens' full participation in a pluralistic democracy, and protect the free exercise of religion.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Establishment of the Religious Liberty Commission.</E>\n                     (a) There is hereby established the Religious Liberty Commission (Commission).\n                </FP>\n                <P>(b) The Commission shall function as follows:</P>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">\n                    (i) The Commission shall be composed of up to 14 members appointed by the President.

On March 14, 2025, I signed Executive Order 14237 (Addressing Risks from Paul Weiss) to address certain issues related to Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP (Paul Weiss). I noted that \u00e2\u0080\u009c[g]lobal law firms have for years played an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Paul Weiss is one of many law firms that have participated in this harmful activity. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>Earlier this week, though, Paul Weiss indicated that it will engage in a remarkable change of course. Specifically, Paul Weiss has acknowledged the wrongdoing of its former partner Mark Pomerantz, and it has agreed to a number of policy changes to promote equality, justice, and the principles that keep our Nation strong, including:  adopting a policy of political neutrality with respect to client selection and attorney hiring; taking on a wide range of pro bono matters representing the full political spectrum; committing to merit-based hiring, promotion, and retention, instead of \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u00e2\u0080\u009d policies; dedicating the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services during my term in office to support causes including assisting our Nation's veterans, fairness in the justice system, and combating anti-Semitism; and other similar initiatives.</FP>\n                <FP>This development should give Americans hope. If the legal profession dedicates a fraction of its energy to bringing justice to local communities, unleashing hard-working businesses, strengthening the American family, and unifying our Nation, all Americans will benefit. </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Revocation</E>\n                     I hereby revoke Executive Order 14237 of March 14, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Paul Weiss).\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 3</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">General Provisions.</E>\n                     (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n                </FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</FP>\n                <P>(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</P>\n                <PRTPAGE P=\"13686\"/>\n                <P>(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</P>\n                <GPH SPAN=\"1\" DEEP=\"80\" HTYPE=\"RIGHT\">\n                    <GID>Trump.EPS</GID>\n                </GPH>\n                <PSIG>\u00e2\u0080\u0083</PSIG>\n                <PLACE>THE WHITE HOUSE,</PLACE>\n                <DATE>March 21, 2025.</DATE>\n                <FRDOC>[FR Doc. 2025-05291 </FRDOC>\n                <FILED>Filed 3-25-25; 8:45 am] </FILED>\n                <BILCOD>Billing code 3395-F4-P</BILCOD>\n            </EXECORD>\n        </PRESDOCU>",

For more than 50 years, outdated and overly restrictive regulations have grounded the promise of supersonic flight over land, stifling American ingenuity, weakening our global competitiveness, and ceding leadership to foreign adversaries. Advances in aerospace engineering, materials science, and noise reduction now make supersonic flight not just possible, but safe, sustainable, and commercially viable. This order begins a historic national effort to reestablish the United States as the undisputed leader in high-speed aviation. By updating obsolete standards and embracing the technologies of today and tomorrow, we will empower our engineers, entrepreneurs, and visionaries to deliver the next generation of air travel, which will be faster, quieter, safer, and more efficient than ever before.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Regulatory Reform for Supersonic Flight.</E>\n                     (a) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) shall take the necessary steps, including through rulemaking, to repeal the prohibition on overland supersonic flight in 14 CFR 91.817 within 180 days of the date of this order and establish an interim noise-based certification standard, making any modifications to 14 CFR 91.818 as necessary, as consistent with applicable law. The Administrator of the FAA shall also take immediate steps to repeal 14 CFR 91.819 and 91.821, which will remove additional regulatory barriers that hinder the advancement of supersonic aviation technology in the United States.\n                </FP>\n                <P>(b) Within 18 months of the date of this order, the Administrator of the FAA shall issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to establish a standard for supersonic aircraft noise certification under 14 CFR Part 36 and amend 14 CFR 91.817. The proposed rule shall define acceptable noise thresholds for takeoff, landing, and en-route supersonic operation based on operational testing and research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) data as identified in subsection 3(a) of this order, and considering community acceptability, economic reasonableness, and technological feasibility. The proposed rule shall further specify a process for periodic review and update of the rule to reflect future advances in aircraft noise reduction technology.

Over the last 5 years, confidence that scientists act in the best interests of the public has fallen significantly. A majority of researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics believe science is facing a reproducibility crisis. The falsification of data by leading researchers has led to high-profile retractions of federally funded research.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Unfortunately, the Federal Government has contributed to this loss of trust. In several notable cases, executive departments and agencies (agencies) have used or promoted scientific information in a highly misleading manner. For example, under the prior Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued COVID-19 guidance on reopening schools that incorporated edits by the American Federation of Teachers and was understood to discourage in-person learning. This guidance's restrictive and burdensome reopening conditions led many schools to remain at least partially closed, resulting in substantial negative effects on educational outcomes\u00e2\u0080\u0094even though the best available scientific evidence showed that children were unlikely to transmit or suffer serious illness or death from the virus, and that opening schools with reasonable mitigation measures would have only minor effects on transmission.</FP>\n                <FP>The National Marine Fisheries Service justified a biological opinion by adopting an admitted \u00e2\u0080\u009cworst-case scenario\u00e2\u0080\u009d projection of the North Atlantic right whale population that it believed was \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery likely\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrong. The agency's proposed actions could have destroyed the historic Maine lobster fishery. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently overturned that opinion because the agency's decision to seek out the worst-case scenario skewed its approach to the evidence.</FP>\n                <FP>Similarly, agencies have used Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario 8.5 to assess the potential effects of climate change in a \u00e2\u0080\u009chigher\u00e2\u0080\u009d warming scenario. RCP 8.5 is a worst-case scenario based on highly unlikely assumptions like end-of-century coal use exceeding estimates of recoverable coal reserves. Scientists have warned that presenting RCP 8.5 as a likely outcome is misleading.</FP>\n                <FP>Actions taken by the prior Administration further politicized science, for example, by encouraging agencies to incorporate diversity, equity, and inclusion considerations into all aspects of science planning, execution, and communication. Scientific integrity in the production and use of science by the Federal Government is critical to maintaining the trust of the American people and ensuring confidence in government decisions informed by science.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    My Administration is committed to restoring a gold standard for science to ensure that federally funded research is transparent, rigorous, and impactful, and that Federal decisions are informed by the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available. We must restore the American people's faith in the scientific enterprise and institutions that create and apply scientific knowledge in service of the public good. Reproducibility, rigor, and unbiased peer review must be maintained. This order restores the scientific integrity policies of my first Administration and ensures \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"22602\"/>\n                    that agencies practice data transparency, acknowledge relevant scientific uncertainties, are transparent about the assumptions and likelihood of scenarios used, approach scientific findings objectively, and communicate scientific data accurately. Agency use of Gold Standard Science, as set forth in this order, will spur innovation, translate discovery to success, and ensure continued American strength and global leadership in technology.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Definitions</E>\n                    .

Moreover, instead of alleviating worker shortages in necessary occupations, the PSLF Program has misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means. The PSLF Program also creates perverse incentives that can increase the cost of tuition, can load students in low-need majors with unsustainable debt, and may push students into organizations that hide under the umbrella of a non-profit designation and degrade our national interest, thus requiring additional Federal funding to correct the negative societal effects caused by these organizations' federally subsidized wrongdoing.</FP>\n                <FP>As President of the United States, I have a duty to protect, preserve, and defend the Constitution and our national security, which includes ending the subsidization of illegal activities, including illegal immigration, human smuggling, child trafficking, pervasive damage to public property, and disruption of the public order, which threaten the security and stability of the United States.

Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Federal Government has not released to the public all of its records related to those events. Their families and the American people deserve transparency and truth. It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 required all records related to the assassination of President Kennedy to be publicly disclosed in full by October 26, 2017, unless the President certifies that: (i) continued postponement is made necessary by an identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations; and (ii) the identifiable harm is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure. President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, section 5(g)(2)(D), Public Law 102-526, 106 Stat. 3443, 3448-49, codified at 44 U.S.C. 2107 note.</FP>\n                <FP>I previously accepted proposed redactions from executive departments and agencies (agencies) in 2017 and 2018, but ordered the continued re-evaluation of those remaining redactions. See Temporary Certification for Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 82 FR 50,307-08 (Oct. 31, 2017); Certification for Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 83 FR 19, 157-58 (Apr. 26, 2018). In the Presidential Memorandum of April 26, 2018, I also ordered agencies to re-review each of those redactions over the next 3 years and disclose information that no longer warrants continued withholding under the standard set forth in section 5(g)(2)(D) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.</FP>\n                <FP>President Biden issued subsequent certifications with respect to these records in 2021, 2022, and 2023, which gave agencies additional time to review the records and withhold information from public disclosure. See Temporary Certification Regarding Disclosure of Information in Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 86 FR 59,599 (Oct. 22, 2021); Certifications Regarding Disclosure of Information in Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 87 FR 77,967 (Dec. 15, 2022); Certification Regarding Disclosure of Information in Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F.

Kennedy is not consistent with the public interest and the release of these records is long overdue. And although no Act of Congress directs the release of information pertaining to the assassinations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I have determined \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"8642\"/>\n                    that the release of all records in the Federal Government's possession pertaining to each of those assassinations is also in the public interest.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Declassification and Disclosure.</E>\n                     (a) Within 15 days of the date of this order, the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General shall, in coordination with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Counsel to the President, present a plan to the President for the full and complete release of records relating to the assassination of President John F.

Biden's son had abandoned his laptop at a computer repair business. Signatories of the letter falsely suggested that the news story was part of a Russian disinformation campaign.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Before being issued, the letter was sent to the CIA Prepublication Classification Review Board, the body typically assigned to formally evaluate the sensitive nature of documents prior to publication. Senior CIA officials were made aware of the contents of the letter, and multiple signatories held clearances at the time and maintained ongoing contractual relationships with the CIA.</FP>\n                <FP>Federal policymakers must be able to rely on analysis conducted by the Intelligence Community and be confident that it is accurate, crafted with professionalism, and free from politically motivated engineering to affect political outcomes in the United States. The signatories willfully weaponized the gravitas of the Intelligence Community to manipulate the political process and undermine our democratic institutions. This fabrication of the imprimatur of the Intelligence Community to suppress information essential to the American people during a Presidential election is an egregious breach of trust reminiscent of a third world country. And now the faith of Americans in all other patriotic intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect the Nation has been imperiled.</FP>\n                <FP>National security is also damaged by the publication of classified information. Former National Security Advisor John R. Bolton published a memoir for monetary gain after he was terminated from his White House position in 2019. The book was rife with sensitive information drawn from his time in government. The memoir's reckless treatment of sensitive information undermined the ability of future presidents to request and obtain candid advice on matters of national security from their staff. Publication also created a grave risk that classified material was publicly exposed.</FP>\n                <FP>To remedy these abuses of the public trust, this Order directs the revocation of any active or current security clearances held by: (i) the former intelligence officials who engaged in misleading and inappropriate political coordination with the 2020 Biden presidential campaign; and (ii) John R. Bolton.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy.</E>\n                     (a) It is the policy of the United States to ensure that the Intelligence Community not be engaged in partisan politics or otherwise used by a U.S. political campaign for electioneering purposes.

It is the policy of the United States, and the purpose of this order, to protect the religious freedoms of Americans and end the anti-Christian weaponization of government. The Founders established a Nation in which people were free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by their government. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    For that reason, the United States Constitution enshrines the fundamental right to religious liberty in the First Amendment. Federal laws like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000bb \n                    <E T=\"03\">et seq</E>\n                    .), further prohibit government interference with Americans' rights to exercise their religion. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e \n                    <E T=\"03\">et seq</E>\n                    .), prohibits religious discrimination in employment while Federal hate-crime laws prohibit offenses committed due to religious animus.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Yet the previous Administration engaged in an egregious pattern of targeting peaceful Christians, while ignoring violent, anti-Christian offenses. The Biden Department of Justice sought to squelch faith in the public square by bringing Federal criminal charges and obtaining in numerous cases multi-year prison sentences against nearly two dozen peaceful pro-life Christians for praying and demonstrating outside abortion facilities. Those convicted included a Catholic priest and 75-year-old grandmother, as well as an 87-year-old woman and a father of 11 children who were arrested 18 months after praying and singing hymns outside an abortion facility in Tennessee as a part of a politically motivated prosecution campaign by the Biden Administration. I rectified this injustice on January 23, 2025, by issuing pardons in these cases. </FP>\n                <FP>At the same time, Catholic churches, charities, and pro-life centers sought justice for violence, theft, and arson perpetrated against them, which the Biden Department of Justice largely ignored. After more than 100 attacks, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning this violence and calling on the Biden Administration to enforce the law.</FP>\n                <FP>Then, in 2023, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) memorandum asserted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cradical-traditionalist\u00e2\u0080\u009d Catholics were domestic-terrorism threats and suggested infiltrating Catholic churches as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthreat mitigation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This later-retracted FBI memorandum cited as support evidence propaganda from highly partisan sources.</FP>\n                <FP>The Biden Department of Education sought to repeal religious-liberty protections for faith-based organizations on college campuses. The Biden Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sought to force Christians to affirm radical transgender ideology against their faith. And the Biden Department of Health and Human Services sought to drive Christians who do not conform to certain beliefs on sexual orientation and gender identity out of the foster-care system. The Biden Administration declared March 31, 2024\u00e2\u0080\u0094Easter Sunday\u00e2\u0080\u0094as \u00e2\u0080\u009cTransgender Day of Visibility.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    In this atmosphere of anti-Christian government, hostility and vandalism against Christian churches and places of worship surged, with the number of such identified acts in 2023 exceeding by more than eight times the \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"9366\"/>\n                    number from 2018. Catholic churches and institutions have been aggressively targeted with hundreds of acts of hostility, violence, and vandalism. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>My Administration will not tolerate anti-Christian weaponization of government or unlawful conduct targeting Christians. The law protects the freedom of Americans and groups of Americans to practice their faith in peace, and my Administration will enforce the law and protect these freedoms. My Administration will ensure that any unlawful and improper conduct, policies, or practices that target Christians are identified, terminated, and rectified. </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Establishing a Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias</E>\n                    .

The Constitution provides the Federal Government with plenary authority regarding immigration to protect the sovereignty of our Nation and to conduct relations with other nations, who must be able to deal with one national Government on such matters. This power is sometimes contained in specific constitutional provisions: Article II of the Constitution vests the power to protect national security and conduct foreign policy in the President of the United States, and Article IV, Section 4, requires the Federal Government to \u00e2\u0080\u009cprotect each of [the States] against Invasion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This Federal power over immigration is also an inherent element of national sovereignty.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>The prior administration allowed unchecked millions of aliens to illegally enter the United States. The resulting public safety and national security risks are exacerbated by the presence of, and control of territory by, international cartels and other transnational criminal organizations along the southern border, as well as terrorists and other malign actors who intend to harm the United States and the American people. This invasion at the southern border requires the Federal Government to take measures to fulfill its obligation to the States.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    Yet some State and local officials nevertheless continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws. This is a lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law and the Federal Government's obligation to defend the territorial sovereignty of the United States. Beyond the intolerable national security risks, such nullification efforts often violate Federal criminal laws, including those prohibiting obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. 1501 \n                    <E T=\"03\">et seq.</E>\n                    ), unlawfully harboring or hiring illegal aliens (8 U.S.C. 1324), conspiracy against the United States (18 U.S.C. 371), and conspiracy to impede Federal law enforcement (18 U.S.C. 372). Assisting aliens in violating Federal immigration law could also violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (18 U.S.C. 1961 \n                    <E T=\"03\">et seq.</E>\n                    ). Some measures to assist illegal aliens also necessarily violate Federal laws prohibiting discrimination against Americans in favor of illegal aliens and protecting Americans' civil rights.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>It is imperative that the Federal Government restore the enforcement of United States law.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Designation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cSanctuary\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jurisdictions.</E>\n                     (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall publish a list of States and local jurisdictions that obstruct the enforcement of Federal immigration laws (sanctuary jurisdictions).

For example, many shippers go to great lengths to evade law enforcement and hide illicit substances in imports that go through international commerce. These shippers conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices. Some of the techniques employed by these shippers to conceal the true contents of the shipments, the identity of the distributors, and the country of origin of the imports include the use of re-shippers in the United States, false invoices, fraudulent postage, and \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"37777\"/>\n                    deceptive packaging.

The United States faces a critical national security imperative to ensure a resilient, secure, and reliable energy supply for critical defense facilities designated under section 824o-1(c) of title 16, United States Code, and other mission capability resources. Advanced computing infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and other mission capability resources at military and national security installations and national laboratories demands reliable, high-density power sources that cannot be disrupted by external threats or grid failures. These facilities and resources' vulnerability to energy disruption represents a strategic risk that must be addressed.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Advanced nuclear reactors include nuclear energy systems like Generation III+ reactors, small modular reactors, microreactors, and stationary and mobile reactors that have the potential to deliver resilient, secure, and reliable power to critical defense facilities and other mission capability resources. However, despite its promise, such technology has not been utilized in the United States at the scale or speed necessary to meet the Nation's urgent national security requirements, while our adversaries are rapidly exporting and deploying such technology around the world.</FP>\n                <FP>The Federal Government must utilize its full authority to accelerate the secure and responsible development, demonstration, deployment, and export of United States designed advanced nuclear technologies to bolster readiness and enhance American technological superiority. Additionally, the United States must further enhance our ability to export our nuclear technology to our allies and commercial partners, strengthening our shared ability to combat reliance on foreign adversaries through the use of safe, secure, and safeguarded nuclear technologies. Therefore, we must unleash the domestic nuclear industrial base and position American nuclear companies as the partners of choice for future energy growth throughout the world.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy</E>\n                    .

Mail theft complaints have increased substantially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, Department of the Treasury checks are 16 times more likely to be reported lost or stolen, returned undeliverable, or altered than an electronic funds transfer (EFT).

But too many children do not thrive in their assigned, government-run K-12 school. According to this year's National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 70 percent of 8th graders were below proficient in reading, and 72 percent were below proficient in math. Moreover, geographically based school assignments exacerbate the cost of housing in districts with preferred schools, straining the finances of millions of American families sacrificing for their children's futures.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>When our public education system fails such a large segment of society, it hinders our national competitiveness and devastates families and communities. For this reason, more than a dozen States have enacted universal K-12 scholarship programs, allowing families\u00e2\u0080\u0094rather than the government\u00e2\u0080\u0094to choose the best educational setting for their children. These States have highlighted the most promising avenue for education reform: educational choice for families and competition for residentially assigned, government-run public schools. The growing body of rigorous research demonstrates that well-designed education-freedom programs improve student achievement and cause nearby public schools to improve their performance.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy.</E>\n                     It is the policy of my Administration to support parents in choosing and directing the upbringing and education of their children.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 3</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Guidance on Supporting State-based K-12 Educational Choice.</E>\n                     Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Education shall issue guidance regarding how States can use Federal formula funds to support K-12 educational choice initiatives.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 4</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Encouraging Education Freedom through Discretionary Grant Programs.</E>\n                     (a) The Secretary of Education shall include education freedom as a priority in discretionary grant programs, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.\n                </FP>\n                <P>(b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education shall review their respective discretionary grant programs and each submit a plan to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, that identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendations regarding using relevant discretionary grant programs to expand education freedom for America's families and teachers.</P>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 5</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Expanding Opportunities for Low-Income, Working Families.</E>\n                     Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall issue guidance regarding whether and how States receiving block grants for families and children from the Department, including the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDGB), can use them to expand educational choice and support families who choose educational alternatives to governmental entities, including private and faith-based options.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 6</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Helping Military Families.</E>\n                     Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall review any available mechanisms under which \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"8860\"/>\n                    military-connected families may use funds from the Department of Defense to attend schools of their choice, including private, faith-based, or public charter schools, and submit a plan to the President describing such mechanisms and the steps that would be necessary to implement them beginning in the 2025-26 school year.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 7</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Helping Children Eligible for Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) Schools.</E>\n                     Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall review any available mechanisms under which families of students eligible to attend BIE schools may use their Federal funding for educational options of their choice, including private, faith-based, or public charter schools, and submit a plan to the President describing such mechanisms and the steps that would be necessary to implement them for the 2025-26 school year.

Unlike in 1967, when the CPB was established, today the media landscape is filled with abundant, diverse, and innovative news options. Government funding of news media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    At the very least, Americans have the right to expect that if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting at all, they fund only fair, accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news coverage. No media outlet has a constitutional right to taxpayer subsidies, and the Government is entitled to determine which categories of activities to subsidize. The CPB's governing statute reflects principles of impartiality: the CPB may not \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontribute to or otherwise support any political party.\u00e2\u0080\u009d 47 U.S.C. 396(f)(3); \n                    <E T=\"03\">see also id.</E>\n                     396(e)(2).\n                </FP>\n                <FP>The CPB fails to abide by these principles to the extent it subsidizes NPR and PBS.

Probationary periods (for employees in the competitive service) and trial periods (for employees in the excepted service) have provided a longstanding critical tool to assess the fitness of newly hired Federal employees before finalizing their appointments to Federal service.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>The Government Accountability Office has documented, however, that agencies have not been using probationary and trial periods as effectively as they could to remove appointees whose continued employment is not in the public interest. As a result of this failure to remove poor performers, agencies have often retained and given tenure to underperforming employees who should have been screened out during their probationary period.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    Conditions of good administration require that agency approval should be required before probationary employees become tenured Federal employees.

For example, when the last workday is a Friday and the anniversary date is the following Monday, a probationer will be separated before the end of the tour of duty on Friday if their agency does not make the requisite certification that their continued appointment advances the public interest.</P>\n                <P>(c) An employee on a probationary or trial period bears the burden of demonstrating why their continuation in employment through the finalization of their appointment to the Federal service is in the public interest.</P>\n                <P>(d) In determining whether it is in the public interest to finalize the appointment to the Federal service of an employee in a probationary or trial period, the agency head, or his or her designee, may consider, in his or her sole and exclusive discretion:</P>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(1) the employee's performance and conduct;</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(2) the needs and interests of the agency;</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(3) whether the employee's continued employment would advance organizational goals of the agency or the Government; and</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(4) whether the employee's continued employment would advance the efficiency of the service.</FP>\n                <P>(e) Before an agency terminates the service of an employee serving a probationary or trial period, it shall notify such employee in writing as to the effective date of the action.</P>\n                <P>\n                    (f) If an agency fails to make a certification under Civil Service Rule 11.5 due to an administrative error, the agency head may petition the Director of OPM within 30 days from the date of termination to reinstate the employee.\n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"17732\"/>\n                </P>\n                <P>(g) This section shall not apply to an employee serving a probationary period due to being promoted, transferred, or otherwise assigned, for the first time, to a supervisory or managerial position, unless such employee is required to concurrently serve both a probationary period in a supervisory or managerial position and a probationary or trial period following initial appointment or reinstatement under this Civil Service Rule.</P>\n                <P>\u00c2\u00a7\u00e2\u0080\u008911.6 Appeals</P>\n                <P>(a) The Director of OPM may by regulation prescribe circumstances under and procedures by which employees terminated from a probationary or trial period may appeal such termination.</P>\n                <P>(b) Except as otherwise required by law, such appeals shall be the sole and exclusive means of appealing terminations during probationary or trial periods.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</P>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 4</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Modifications to the Civil Service Regulations.</E>\n                     (a) This order supersedes subpart H of part 315 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations (Probation on Initial Appointment to a Competitive Position), which is hereby rendered inoperative and without effect.

Unlocking this bounty of natural wealth will raise the prosperity of our citizens while helping to enhance our Nation's economic and national security for generations to come. By developing these resources to the fullest extent possible, we can help deliver price relief for Americans, create high-quality jobs for our citizens, ameliorate our trade imbalances, augment the Nation's exercise of global energy dominance, and guard against foreign powers weaponizing energy supplies in theaters of geopolitical conflict.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Unleashing this opportunity, however, requires an immediate end to the assault on Alaska's sovereignty and its ability to responsibly develop these resources for the benefit of the Nation.

An affordable and reliable domestic energy supply is essential to the national and economic security of the United States, as well as our foreign policy. Simply put, Americans are better off when the United States is energy dominant.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>American energy dominance is threatened when State and local governments seek to regulate energy beyond their constitutional or statutory authorities. For example, when States target or discriminate against out-of-State energy producers by imposing significant barriers to interstate and international trade, American energy suffers, and the equality of each State enshrined by the Constitution is undermined. Similarly, when States subject energy producers to arbitrary or excessive fines through retroactive penalties or seek to control energy development, siting, or production activities on Federal land, American energy suffers.</FP>\n                <FP>Many States have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, burdensome and ideologically motivated \u00e2\u0080\u009cclimate change\u00e2\u0080\u009d or energy policies that threaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security. New York, for example, enacted a \u00e2\u0080\u009cclimate change\u00e2\u0080\u009d extortion law that seeks to retroactively impose billions in fines (erroneously labelled \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompensatory payments\u00e2\u0080\u009d) on traditional energy producers for their purported past contributions to greenhouse gas emissions not only in New York but also anywhere in the United States and the world. Vermont similarly extorts energy producers for alleged past contributions to greenhouse gas emissions anywhere in the United States or the globe.</FP>\n                <FP>Other States have taken different approaches in an effort to dictate national energy policy. California, for example, punishes carbon use by adopting impossible caps on the amount of carbon businesses may use, all but forcing businesses to pay large sums to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrade\u00e2\u0080\u009d carbon credits to meet California's radical requirements. Some States delay review of permit applications to produce energy, creating de facto barriers to entry in the energy market. States have also sued energy companies for supposed \u00e2\u0080\u009cclimate change\u00e2\u0080\u009d harm under nuisance or other tort regimes that could result in crippling damages.</FP>\n                <FP>These State laws and policies weaken our national security and devastate Americans by driving up energy costs for families coast-to-coast, despite some of these families not living or voting in States with these crippling policies. These laws and policies also undermine Federalism by projecting the regulatory preferences of a few States into all States. Americans must be permitted to heat their homes, fuel their cars, and have peace of mind\u00e2\u0080\u0094free from policies that make energy more expensive and inevitably degrade quality of life.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    These State laws and policies try to dictate interstate and international disputes over air, water, and natural resources; unduly discriminate against \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"15514\"/>\n                    out-of-State businesses; contravene the equality of States; and retroactively impose arbitrary and excessive fines without legitimate justification.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>These State laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration's objective to unleash American energy.

Recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Members of the Government of Brazil have taken actions that interfere with the economy of the United States, infringe the free expression rights of United States persons, violate human rights, and undermine the interest the United States has in protecting its citizens and companies. Members of the Government of Brazil are also politically persecuting a former President of Brazil, which is contributing to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Brazil, to politically motivated intimidation in that country, and to human rights abuses.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Recently, members of the Government of Brazil have taken unprecedented actions that harm and are a threat to the economy of the United States, conflict with and threaten the policy of the United States to promote free speech and free and fair elections at home and abroad, and violate fundamental human rights. Indeed, certain Brazilian officials have issued orders to compel United States online platforms to censor the accounts or content of United States persons, where such accounts or content are protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution within the United States; block the ability of United States persons to raise money on their platforms; change their content moderation policies, enforcement practices, or algorithms in ways that may result in the censorship of the content and accounts of United States persons; and provide the user data of accounts belonging to United States persons, facilitating the targeting of political critics in the United States.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    For example, Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has abused his judicial authority to target political opponents, shield corrupt allies, and suppress dissent, often in coordination with other Brazilian officials. Justice de Moraes has authorized politically motivated police raids, arrests, and bank account freezes. He has also authorized the confiscation of passports, jailed individuals without trial for social media posts, opened unprecedented criminal investigations, including into United States citizens for their constitutionally protected speech in the United States, and issued secret orders to United States social media companies to censor thousands of posts and de-platform dozens of political critics, including United States persons, for lawful speech on United States soil. When United States and United States-headquartered companies have refused to comply with his unlawful censorship demands, Justice de Moraes has imposed substantial fines on United States and United States-headquartered companies, ordered the suspension of United States and United States-headquartered companies in Brazil, and threatened United States and United States-headquartered \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"37740\"/>\n                    company executives with criminal prosecution. In fact, Justice de Moraes is currently overseeing the Government of Brazil's criminal prosecution of a United States resident for speech he made on United States soil.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>These judicial actions, taken under the pretext of combatting \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisinformation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cfake news,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009canti-democratic\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009chateful\u00e2\u0080\u009d content, endanger the economy of the United States by tyrannically and arbitrarily coercing United States companies to censor political speech, turn over sensitive United States user data, or change their content moderation policies on pain of extraordinary fines, criminal prosecution, asset freezes, or complete exclusion from the Brazilian market. These actions also chill and limit expression in the United States, violate human rights, and undermine the interest that the United States has in protecting its citizens and companies at home and abroad.</FP>\n                <FP>Brazilian officials are also persecuting former President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro. The Government of Brazil has unjustly charged Bolsonaro with multiple crimes related to Bolsonaro's 2022 runoff election, and the Supreme Court of Brazil has misguidedly ruled that Bolsonaro must stand trial for these unjustified criminal charges. Political persecution, through drummed up prosecutions, threatens the orderly development of Brazil's political, administrative, and economic institutions, including undermining the ability of Brazil to hold a free and fair election of the presidency in 2026. The Government of Brazil's treatment of former President Bolsonaro also contributes to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Brazil, to politically motivated intimidation in that country, and to human rights abuses.</FP>\n                <FP>I find that the unprecedented actions taken by the Government of Brazil have violated the free expression rights of United States persons, interfered with the economy of the United States by coercing United States and United States-headquartered companies to censor United States persons for speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution on pain of extraordinary fines, criminal prosecution, asset freezes, or complete exclusion from the Brazilian market, subverted the interest of the United States in protecting its citizens and companies, undermined the rule of law in Brazil, and jeopardized the orderly development of Brazil's political, administrative, and economic institutions. The policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil are repugnant to the moral and political values of democratic and free societies and conflict with the policy of the United States to promote democratic governments throughout the world, the principle of free expression and free and fair elections, the rule of law, and respect for human rights.</FP>\n                <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the scope and gravity of the recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States and hereby declare a national emergency with respect to that threat.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    To deal with the national emergency declared in this order, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to impose an additional \n                    <E T=\"03\">ad valorem</E>\n                     duty rate of 40 percent on certain products of Brazil, as detailed below.
